Why am I here?

I don't know what I'm doing here.

I've never had much desire to blog. It's not because I'm too busy (I'm
not), or I don't have anything interesting to say (oh, I *do*), but I
just don't have a lot of desire to say anything on a blog.

It's amazing. I mean, I buy myself a domain and webspace to use it, and
what happens to it? `Hani`_ ends up using it, and I just sit on my butt,
frozen by a combination of inertia and what probably amounts to stage
fright. Which is funny, since I end up going to blog meetings, but hey,
I don't have an active blog any more. If it wasn't for the company I'd
wonder why I go.

I mean, here. Once again, today, I had something to say, and Hani told
me to blog about it. Except that now, dressed in what is probably a
blogger's version of a suit with no pants on, I stand, rooted in the
spot, with nothing but what passes for “a-buh, a-buh, a-buh-bwuh-bwuh”
for bloggers.

A-buh, a-buh, a-bwuh-bwuh-bwuh. Dur.

Someone said that my blog entries sounded angry. Yeah, they do.
Typically angry with myself, but yeah, angry.

God, why am I here?
