Did you know, `Hani`_ and I nearly missed `the blog meet`_?

Honestly, we thought it was going to be held at the 3rd floor food
court. It was fifteen minutes later did we realized that that court
wasn’t called Oasis, and we went downstairs.

First impressions.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You know, you can tell when a grouping of bloggers are sitting together.
When a bunch of people are huddled together in a food court, not eating
but instead just *talking* about stuff and fondling digital gadgets, you
know you’ve got a meeting of bloggers.

But yeah! I got to meet with `Peter Tan`_ (he waved at me! OMG! That’s
so cool.) And I met `Sashi`_ for the first time. Man, he’s skinnier than
I expected. Yeah, I guess he does write like a fat guy.

Surreality

Oh, and I met `Claire`_ for the first time. Oh, oh, oh, and `MENJ`_, I
got to meet MENJ. That particular meet was surreal. See, the guy had
apparently waged some kind of covert war thing on me when I first went
on this blog. He took it the wrong way and there was some name-calling.

Yeah, it was surreal.

There was this `other gir!`_! She had come from her ballet exam, so she
was really sweaty and [STRIKEOUT:hot] warm! I didn’t have a problem with
that at all. Nosir.

So Many People, Cannot Keep Track
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   </p>

And then there were so many people! And two people shoved their
recording devices to my face, and interviewed me. That particular bit
was weird and scary.

   </p>

But it was fun! I guess. Wouldn’t mind doing it again. Only, er, next
time, can we do it somewhere other than a food court? Oasis had this
weird smell, and there were all these people….
