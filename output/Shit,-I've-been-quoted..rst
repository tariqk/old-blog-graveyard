S***, I've been quoted.

Let me first state that the reason why I said yes to answering Shin's
questionnaire for `this article`_ is because I'm an attention-seeking
whore. Let that be known.

And on to the two points elaborated by the article, before I go on about
other things I *did* say to Shin. Since he did say he was getting a
bunch of people to answer him, and he's writing for a political party's
website, I don't blame him for not representing my view completely. To
give him credit, though, he represented my view fairly accurately.

#. Yes, I did think the whole Jeff Ooi saga was a mess. I'd even call it
   a fucking fiasco. Yes, the government did stretch its credibility on
   this one. So did other bloggers, though, for jumping into the
   bandwagon and mindlessly calling Jalan Riong every name they could
   think of.
#. I *do* try to moderate the comments here— as well as I possibly can.
   Personal insults to me, I generally keep, especially if I think the
   insult is not worth my attention. Personal insults to people I know
   and like, or generally racist and inflammatory shit, I delete. I
   can't ban you, but I'll tell you to STFU if you don't fucking behave.

Now, for the points not covered by Shin *et al*.

Of who and why they did this to Jeff, I don't know or care. I will,
however, comment on the result: big fuckup, dudes. Not that I don't
expect anything better from you, but still, you fucked up.
Congratulations.

We've apparently mastered the technology and infrastructure behind the
whole Internet thing, but that's easy — it's a matter of memorization
and familliarity, and even idiots can do it if they put their minds to
it. I mean, take a look at some of the bloggers who are online and
you'll see what I mean.

   </p>

Yeah. Buncha poindexters.

I also told Shin that I hate feedback in general. There's a reason why I
don't allow anonymous comments, and this is it. Given the chance, I
wouldn't allow comments in a blog until I see the email address of the
commenter, send a message to him to check that the email account is
real, and by then still hold the right to muzzle the little shit if he
pisses me off. All Blogger allows me to do is screen out non-Blogger
account owners. I can live with that. For now.

I also described the newspaper industry as a ‘creaky, corrupt edifice’.
But I also called bloggers ‘wanky, elitist prod-noses and memetic
vigilantes’. There are reasons for this; some of it is because some of
you *are*. Or all of you are, sometimes.

   </p>

Because of this, I suggested that bloggers and newspapermen learn to
work together, because more often than not the both of you will find
that it is better to pool your resources and work on each other's
strengths rather than pontificate about how the Other Guy is Evil or
Stupid or Misguided. Stop it.

Just shut up and learn to cooperate with one another, why don't you?
