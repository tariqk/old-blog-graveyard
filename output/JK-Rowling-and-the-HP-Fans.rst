We bought *two* copies of the book; the ‘adult’ edition for this house,
and the ‘children’'s edition for my mother's place in Bangkok.

Yes, cost a fortune. Yes, it was worth it, because my sister and I could
read it and not squabble over it.

My sister and I have finished reading the books. Took me about 12 hours,
but I took breaks, unlike `a certain fellow blogger`_, who did 7 hours
of non-stop swotting.

Can't say I'm too upset by the death of the major character. For one
thing, we already knew she was going to do it again, after book five. No
big deal.

Okay, granted I was hoping the feller would come back to life again, but
that would have been cheap. So I guess that's that.

Mildly disappointed by the Judas, though. It seemed so obvious,
hindsight, but I didn't exactly want to believe.

Oh well. Looks like Book 7 will be interesting.

Mind you, the whole series is beginning to get the feel of a teen movie.
Which sucks, because I **hate** teen movies.
