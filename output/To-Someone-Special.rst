The smell of you, freshly showered.

   </p>

Your laughter, high-pitched and joyful, when I hold you close.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Your exuberance. Do you know that other people can see that in you?

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Your eyes. Did you know that when we're together, those eyes are large
and deep enough to swallow me in their depths?

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Your soft skin. The feel of your hands on my back. You're pretty good at
what you do -- no one scratches my back like you.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

You're a lot of things to me. We've been together for so long; least, it
feels like that.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I miss you, even when you're near. You're like candy. My candy.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

And there's no one else like you.
