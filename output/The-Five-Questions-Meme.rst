`Pick Yin`_ sent me these questions, and hell, since she's such a nice
gal, I decided to answer 'em for her.

   What is the status of your role playing game? Do I get to watch or what?
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. raw:: html

      </p>

   That's a very good question. For those who have no idea what Pick Yin
   is talking about, go `here`_.

   .. raw:: html

      </p>

   Anyway. What's happening? Well, as of *today*, I've heard and begun
   work on getting five out of the six player's paperwork sorted out.
   The last person, who apparently will be `Ash`_, I will see sometime
   later this week so that much hammering and negotiating and
   interviewing can be done. After that, planning for the session
   itself.

   The final date's not set yet, but it will tentatively be Sunday, May
   29\ :sup:`th`. It's a Sunday because everyone's free then. I'll tell
   the people involved, which I hope will include you, Pick Yin, as the
   observer. Anyone else interested will have to wait — it's already
   crowded enough as it is.

   If you're given a chance to lead any country, which will it be and why?
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. raw:: html

   This one. Because it's my home and it could use some improvin'. Now,
   about those work camps….

   What is your opinion on hypocrisy?
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. raw:: html

      </p>

   I don't like it. I could rant and rave about how despicable and
   undesirable it is, especially in our Great and Exalted Leaders, but
   that's in a sense a kind of hypocrisy, isn't it? I mean, talk and
   talk, but what do you do?

   .. raw:: html

      </p>

   So, I say I don't like it. And leave it at that.

   Do you still look the same? I haven't seen you and `HANI`_ for months. What happened to our appointments?
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. raw:: html

   My god, you're right. We've been neglecting you like totally. I've
   tried messaging you over YM, but you don't seem to be replying. Maybe
   I should just give you a call….

   When is the next durian pigout? I'm waiting.
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   .. raw:: html

   My god. I still have rashes and pimples from the last one.

   On a more serious note, I don't know. The nice lady who took care of
   the orchard for us has decided to return to her grandchildren up
   north, so I have no idea what's happening to my dad's orchard in
   Langat. All I can say is that we still have it, but as for its state…
   I don't rightly know. I really should be asking my dad about it, but
   I think he just quit smoking, and he's been a bit… *cranky* of late,
   so, uh….
