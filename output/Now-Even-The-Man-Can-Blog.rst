    Hey, Jeff, I think what Mahathir needs is a blog!. You think you can
    help him create one that he can administer and run and of course
    write all his comments and of course we shall have a link to it from
    your blog. And then we can all talk directly to Mahathir. Might perk
    him up a bit and I think it will be really good for his health too.

Excuse me while I giggle madly. The Mahathir Blog!

While our local politicians blogging is about as likely as me winning
the next General Elections single-handedly and blindfolded, here are
some considerations to future politician-bloggers:

#. Make an effort to post on a regular basis. Either learn the tools
   yourself, or dictate it to someone, but whatever you do, you must do
   it yourself.
#. Spend some time track-backing. It would be considered ‘interacting
   with the Malaysian blogosphere’. You may not have time, in your busy
   schedule, but it's not something an enthusiastic research aide will
   do. Be sure to vet each link before you go — the last thing you need
   is a link to Something Objectionable.
#. Get your own provider. While Blogger is good for plebians like us,
   famous people like you will require a medium that can provide an
   effective spam-fighting platform and yet be accessible enough to be
   interacted with. We recommend `Wordpress`_, ourselves.
#. Want to post something private and personal? I recommend
   `LiveJournal`_. Not only will your entries be relatively safe, but
   there is a rich community that you might enjoy. Invite other fellow
   politicians and statesmen, and form a community! Squee at the latest
   Larry King episode, or whatever it is you old fogeys do to pass the
   time.
#. Oh, and when you do get your own hosting solution or whatever, make
   sure to either register it yourself, or get someone with a **clear**
   and visible link to you to do so. Leave clear communications details,
   so that people can communicate with you if they whois you. Make sure
   that you're able to prove that you are who you are.

That's about it. Good luck with your foray into the horrid morass that
is blogdom!
