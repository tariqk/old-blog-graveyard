I know. I have no sense of meter, rhyme or reason.

But it was still fun to do.

Sk8tr B3nG (with apologies to Avril Lavigne)

| He an Ah Beng,

| She an Ah Lian,

Aiseh macha ca-an you see it or not?

.. raw:: html

   </p>

| He mod his car,

| Jual Vee Cee Day,

Wahlau man Aiseh.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

| He wanted her,

| We said bloody hell,

Thing was that she wanted him as well.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

| But all of her friends,

| All shook their head

| "If you be damn-careless,

You'll end up dead."

.. raw:: html

   </p>

| He was a Sk8t3r B3nG

| She said see you l8r B3nG

| He was too dangerous for her

| She had a pretty dress

| (But didn't have any breasts)

She needed to come back down to Earth…

.. raw:: html

   </p>

| Two years from now, she sits at home,

| She fail her CLP, all alone.

| She bukak Fortune, guess what she see,

| Sk8t3r B3nG! (wah, he dress damn fansee!),

| She call all her fren, they say ya lor,

| Now he a damn big kau kau tai kor.

| She reads the mag, looks at the pic,

Looks at the man she once called a dick…

.. raw:: html

   </p>

| He was a Sk8t3r B3nG,

| She said see you l8r B3nG,

| Didn't you say he no future,

| Now look his portfolio,

| Damn big also ya no?

Too bad you not stick with the fler…(2x)

.. raw:: html

   </p>

| Too bad Ah Lian, you miss out,

| Kesian but he's all mine now,

| Go to Nuovo, dance all nite,

We tiew a lot and never fight.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

| Too bad that chew couldn't see,

| Saw Ah Beng where Tai Kor be,

| He is more than meet the eye,

When we tiew I feel like, ‘die’.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

| He an Ah Beng, I'm a Datin,

| Aiyah daling ca-an you see it or not,

| He a Big Shot, I a Widow,

And we rock each other's umm, you know…!

.. raw:: html

   </p>

| I'm with a Sk8t3r B3nG,

| I said see you l8tr B3nG,

| Nanti we jumpa at Bangsar.

| Then we go to his condo,

| Tiew until tomolo,

And talk about this girl he know… (x2)
