I can feel my sense of humor draining away.

I don’t like the kind of questions that popped in my head when I read
this:

    ...I was more upset seeing the ugly side of a foreign-owned private
    hospital in Cheras, which doesn’t even wink staring at a life dying
    at its doorstep.

Get Angry, Moralize.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

The predictable response to this is readily obvious—anger, shock,
disgust. It *is* the worst thing to happen to one’s child, and the
feelings of helplessness and anger and sorrow that the parents of the
victim and our feelings are *real*. Let us not deny that.

I’m going to talk about my own personal reaction to this post.

First Impressions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

The first thing that popped into my head when I read the news was
this—“How many other people have gone through something like this?”

What drew my eye to this whole post were these parts:

    Two nights ago, as I was following TV3’s news coverage on Noh Omar,
    I stumped onto visuals of DPM Najib’s wife, who was sobbing
    uncontrollably.

    I was told Khairul’s family was known to Rosmah Mansor, wife of
    Deputy Prime Minister Najib Razak, as Khairul and her daughter were
    classmates at the international school in Damansara.

The Stain
~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Understand this. I am not belittling the death of that boy. What
happened to him was horrible, unexcusable, and a terrible stain for
Malaysians everywhere.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

But the thing is, if the classmate of the daughter of `officially the
second-most powerful man`_ in Malaysia can die from simple, *criminal*
neglect, because that’s what it *is*, how many other people have gone
through this, have died because of this?

Jolted Awake
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

It should not take the death of the child of someone influential to jolt
us out of our fucking sleep. It shouldn’t. It shouldn’t take the death
of someone known to influential people to get our ministers to say that
they’ll revoke the fucking license of pricks who put profit before
ethics.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

It should take a crowd of angry people *several decades ago* to say,
“Fuck this. We don’t want to be treated like bags of money with a straw
in it.” The **market** should have caught this error and fixed it.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

But it didn’t, so here we are. The system failed. *Quelle surprise?*

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Ugly rumors, uglier truth?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I’ve heard tales of bodies of the recently-deceased held by private
hospitals who refused to let the body be treated with dignity and
respect, the way *human beings* are supposed to be treated. Hell, there
were dying people, **fellow Malaysians**, who were, apparently, refused
treatment because they didn’t have time to pony up the goods.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

How many times has this happened? How many times were the people
involved in it ignored, threatened or cajoled to shutting the fuck up
and letting this pseudo-hypercapitalistic piece of shit we call the
status quo continue? Hundreds of times? Dozens? A few? Once?

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Once is too much.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

It *is* a tragedy. It *is* terrible. Here’s something to chew on,
though: the story wouldn’t have gotten such big coverage if the boy’s
family was poor or not well-connected. Ministers would have said nothing
if the boy was some poor nobody from Klang. Nothing would have happened
if this was some old guy who died of a stroke because groups of
tight-fisted cunts who have the fucking *gall* to call themselves
hospitals refused treatment.

So. Where does that leave us?

**Edited**: I’ve realized that some of you might have misconstrued a
couple of my statements as racist and unnecessary. Frankly, since I
didn’t intend it to be that way, I have removed a significant portion of
what looked like racist remarks. Remind me if you see any more, why
don’t you?
