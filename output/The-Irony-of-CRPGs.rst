Before you do anything, go to `this website`_. Download the game, create
your character, and play it for a while.

Or, in actual fact. Run it for a while. You'll see what I mean. Just run
it. Run it and leave it running for a while, until you get sick of it,
and then continue reading this entry. It'll still be here when you're
done.

Bit of a bummer, wasn't it? Did any one of you find it amusing? Did you
get the essence of the joke? Yeah, it is a joke, in a sense; and a joke
that sadly illustrates the state of computer-role playing games right
now.

I mean, okay. It's kinda funny and scary at the same time, the way
satire should be. But it really shows you, honestly, that that's what an
CRPG, no matter how advanced in terms of features and interaction, is
essentially no different than rogue(6).

Not that that's a bad thing, when you really think about it. Except that
a whole generation of people will grow up thinking that hey, this is
what role-playing games are all about — a combination of power fantasy,
tedious number-crunching and somewhat odious obsession.

The worst offenders tend to be the most popular: games like EverQuest
and Ragnarok Online spring into mind. Actually, Ragnarok Online is
particularly sour for me, since `GameFlier`_, RO's distributor in
Malaysia, seems to think that the best way to run the game is to screw
it up for everyone. But that's a different story, and not mine to tell.

Basically? The game you just played, that small snippet of 320KB, that
wonderful piece of satire you just played… that's the essense of
computer role playing games. Whack something, take stuff from it, sell
it, repeat ad nauseam.

There isn't much else I want to say. Except that the best places for
CRPGs are not always the most obvious, or the most commercially popular
ones. The funny part is I can't think of any right now. Well,
`Nethack`_. Now that's the ultimate hack-and-slash game.
