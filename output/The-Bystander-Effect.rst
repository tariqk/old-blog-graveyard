The Bystander Effect.

There's been a lot of moralizing lately about the `bystander effect`_.
That the thing that causes large groups of people to… well, become
bystanders.

I won't join my `fellow`_ `bloggers`_ `in`_ `lament`_, thanks. Done to
the death (pun not intended). Why not look at the problem instead?

    “The **bystander effect** (also known as **bystander apathy**) is a
    psychological phenomenon where persons are less likely to intervene
    in an emergency situation when others are present than when they are
    alone.

    .. raw:: html

       </p>

    Solitary individuals will typically intervene if another person is
    in need of help: this is known as bystander intervention. However,
    researchers were surprised to find that help is less likely to be
    given if more people are present. In some situations, a large group
    of bystanders may fail to help a person who obviously needs help.”

Fucked up, kan? Turns out it's something that happens a lot, nowadays,
especially once we move into the disconnected po–industrial society we
live in. We've had it since the murder of `Kitty Genovese`_, and we'll
continue having it. It's been studied extensively, and all that, and now
we may know why….

    “…with others present, observers all assume that someone else is
    going to intervene and so they each individually refrain from doing
    so…

    .. raw:: html

       </p>

    People may also assume that other bystanders may be more qualified
    to help, such as being a doctor or police officer, and their
    intervention would thus be unneeded. People may also fear ‘losing
    face’ in front of the other bystanders, being superseded by a
    ‘superior’ helper, or offering unwanted assistance.

    .. raw:: html

       </p>

    Another explanation is that bystanders monitor the reactions of
    other people in an emergency situation to see if others think that
    it is necessary to intervene. Since others are doing exactly the
    same, everyone concludes from the inaction of others that other
    people do not think that help is needed…”

The good news is, however, that it might be possible to counter this
effect, by

    “…picking a specific person in the crowd to appeal to for help
    rather than appealing to the larger group generally. [Doing so]
    places all responsibility on that specific person, instead of
    allowing it to diffuse… [it may also show] that all bystanders are
    indeed interested in helping; and it kicks in social proof when one
    or more of the crowd steps in to assist.”

Here's hoping you may never need to do this, but if you do find yourself
in trouble and surrounded by a crowd of rubber–necking idiots, the best
thing you can do is pick out someone, and appeal to *them*, not the
crowd in general.

Hey, I suppose it's risky, but in `some`_ `cases`_ `there`_ ain't much
else you can do….

Maybe what we need are victim classes, in which ways to break that
apathy barrier are thought. Hmm.
