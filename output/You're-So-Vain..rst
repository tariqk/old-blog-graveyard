You're So Vain.

I was going through Petaling Street, trying to find something to stave
off this desire to go sleep, and I stumbled across `this`_.

    | You walked into the party

    | Like you were walking onto a yacht

    | Your hat strategically dipped below one eye

    | Your scarf it was apricot

    | You had one eye in the mirror

    | As you watched yourself gavotte

    | And all the girls dreamed that they'd be your partner

    They'd be your partner, and

Yeah, that song started popping up in my head. I mean, it's true, isn't
it? Pretty people are vain and self-obssessed and boring and stupid and
dull. That's the stereotypes pretty people face, in much the same way
that the technologically blind always turn to geeky looking people
hoping that they can fix whatever ails their busted commercial gadget.

Think geek, and you imagine some loser in glasses and tatty clothes, who
[STRIKEOUT:plays] lives for World of Warcraft or tabletop wargaming or
frenzied masturbation. Think pretty, and she's just some idiot woman who
spends a fortune in Strüdels to be insulted by shitty pastries, or
Bangsar or Sri Hartamas or wherever it is that the ‘hip’ congregate to
spawn, fornicate, network, prevaricate and perform other nefarious and
otherwise mysterious deeds that only Hip and Happening people do.

    | You're so vain

    | You probably think this song is about you

I mean, really, folks. Get a grip. So what if `minishorts`_ calls you `a
fucking beggar`_? So what if the most you'll achieve in the community
would be a five-second quote from Great `Big`_ `Men`_, and then it's
back to Iowa for you? Why are you in here anyway, for the fame and
fortune?

*What fame and fortune?*

    | You had me several years ago

    | When I was still quite naive

    | Well, you said that we made such a pretty pair

    | And that you would never leave

    | But you gave away the things you loved

    | And one of them was me

    | I had some dreams they were clouds in my coffee

    Clouds in my coffee, and

Forget it. You came in here to be loved and adored, you're in the wrong
place. Don't hope you'll end up like the people you see in the news, all
bright-eyed and shiny and hopeful and idealistic and brilliant.

It's an unrewarding hobby. For ninety percent of you, you'll never get
an audience beyond a thousand people during the whole lifetime of your
blog. Even then you'd be lucky. The only to be famous is if you're
`obsessive-compulsive`_, `exhibitionist :sub:`[NSFW]` (nice ribs)`_, or
just `plain`_ `offensive`_. And frankly, that might just net an arrest
for all you know.

Why do I do this? Because I want to have my say. I love having my say.
And because I have this problem with avoiding eye contact in real life.
It's a bad habit I'm trying to break, but I don't have it online. And I
can talk here, sort of. Well, actually, sometimes not here, but this is
where it's safe to just drop my pants and moon the rest of the world.
*And no one will give a shit.*

It pisses me off when people talk about blogging as a ‘Great Way to Meet
People And Experience New Things’, thus giving a whole new generation of
bloggers Exactly the Wrong Idea. You blog, children, because you are
compelled; either you can shut up or they can't cover you up, either
way's fine.

Blogging isn't the new journalism. It's the new “Screaming At The
Sidewalk While Everyone Around You Tries To Avoid Your Eye”. It's not
about who hears you, but what you say. Stop listening to the audience.
You won't starve to death if you suck — unless you're stupid enough to
try blogging for a living.

I don't have blog-tracking software. I don't know how many people visit.
Or care. I don't care if you do or don't care. That's not my business;
I'm just here because I've got something to say and this is a great
place to say it.

    | Well, I hear you went up to Saratoga

    | And your horse naturally won

    | Then you flew your Lear jet up to Nova Scotia

    | To see the total eclipse of the sun

    | Well, you're where you should be all the time

    | And when you're not, you're with

    | Some underworld spy or the wife of a close friend

I mean, seriously. `Hani`_ loves checking her stats. Once in a while
`Jeff`_ and `Aminuddin`_ occasionally post their stats online and tell
the whole world how great [STRIKEOUT:they] the blogosphere is getting,
and how their blogs are [STRIKEOUT:tedious wastes of newsreader
real-estate] valuable avenues of discourse among young Malaysians. I'm
sure some of you wonder how many people come into your blog, and how
often they come.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Honestly, I don't know how many people come here. Nor do I care. What I
do care is their answer to this question — why are they here?

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Do you expect me to perform for you? Because I don't. Do you expect me
to listen to your cares and sympathize? Because I don't. Do you expect
nipplace and nudity? Sorry, try somewhere else.

You're here because of coincidence. You find my shit interesting, and I
write, to you anyway, interesting shit.

Incidentally, I blogged about it because CS's comments page seemed
broken. Oh well. Congratulations, CS. I'm your whore.

Huh. His TrackBack's fucked as well. What the hell is up with that?
