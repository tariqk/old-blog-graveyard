YARP

Yeah, yeah. Basically, this is another Ramadhan post, just like
`Hani`_'s, `Pick Yin`_'s `Najah`_'s, `Zsarina`_'s, `Jordan`_'s,
`Idlan`_'s, `Dina`_'s, `Ash`_'s, oh, hell, who knows. You're a Muslim?
You're fasting? Post lah your YARP, before they take away your blogger's
license.

Funny thing is, I can never seem to connect to Najah's and Zsarina's
blogs. They always time out on me. I wonder why.

Anyway. Ramadhan. That time of the year again. Hell, what do I put in
for my YARP? We've had our `obligatory musings`_, the `occasional
Qur'anic verse`_, tales of how `converts deal`_ `with Ramadhan`_ and
`what not`_. Personally, I like `Dina's Ramadhan post`_ best -- `this
one`_ doesn't count, it's too short. It reminds me that the puasa is not
just a religious thing, but an essentially human thing, with all the
stupidities and snobberies associated with it.

I know, I know. Not happy with something until I take it down. I'm not
very sentimental at all, am I? Not really. Yes, I know the significance
of Ramadhan, as well as the associated hikmah that Ramadhan is supposed
to teach. But every time this month comes I am assaulted not by
holiness, but by memory.

My past two Ramadhans have been easy, but completely lonely. This is the
first time in two years where it feels like I am performing the ibadah
as a member of a community, not as an isolated Muslim in a sea of
unbelievers. I didn't hang around the Muslim community in London a lot,
see.

I kept forgetting how *social* Ramadhan was, until I didn't have that
buffer surrounding me. Alone, by myself, I was reminded how precarious
my situation was, and it hurt. It rubbed my soul raw, in a sense,
because I felt like I had no anchor -- either with family or my fellow
Muslim friends.

Not this time. Yesterday we ended up having buka puasa with some
friends. Blew a fortune, but it was worth it. Tonight is more or less
the same, except that I won't be blowing a fortune -- the food will
hopefully be free. As a matter of fact, I'm pretty sure this year I'll
never be breaking fast alone. If I can help it, I never want to break
fast alone again.

I'm glad I'm home.
