`Pick Yin`_ did this, and she tagged me. I had an odd time doing this,
really. I haven’t thought about my childhood much, much less talked
about it to anyone here.

   </p>

But anyway, here it is.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

1985: 20 years ago.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

My earliest memory. I am in my grandmother’s house. It is late morning.
I am walking in, and I see the family dining table. I see old photos,
medals, rememberances. The floor is terazzo.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

My grandfather calls to me, calling me by a name no one else uses:
“Muhammad Tariq”. He is a jolly fat mamak man, who dotes on me and
spoils me.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I have a younger brother, just two years old. He is chubby and cute, and
I bully him often, as older brothers do.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I love the television; often too much, as I often stand in front of it,
blocking everyone else’s view. It’s a bad habit I will eventually
abandon.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I start kindergarten this year. My first day, and I see a beautiful,
blond-haired fair-skinned girl and fall in love with her, thus setting a
rather unfortunate trend on my relationships with the opposite sex.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

The only times I will ever feel this way again will happen after harsh
bouts of illness, when I am young and fragile again, and the world feels
fresh and renewed.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I am 4 years old.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

1995: 10 years ago.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I am a `Cempakan`_, and I hate it here. It’s probably the hormones, and
some of the isolation. I don’t feel like I belong here.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I have seen death visit twice; once to take my baby sister away after
seven months of life, the second time to take my grandfather away.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I have another baby sister. She is 4 years old. After the death of my
late sister, she comes into the family like tinkle bells and the spring
breeze. Everyone loves her.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I have established a reputation of being an underachieving social
outcast. I am often lonely and frustrated. My parents note how angry I
often seem to be.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

My brother is now taller than I am. He seems more popular as well. We
don’t get along too well.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

If Simple Plan was popular, and if I cared about music, I would have
been their biggest fan.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I discover the Internet, and at almsot the same breath, thanks to `*the*
article`_ in Time, easy access to pornography. Really easy. A love-hate
relationship begins.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I am 14 years old.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

2000: 5 years ago.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I am in `INTI College Subang Jaya`_, which, after Cempaka, is a welcome
change. I lose some of the rage, but the loneliness remains. A string of
stalky “relationships” begins.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I move from my house in Ampang to a place in Petaling Jaya. At least we
don’t have to wake up at bloody daybreak to get anywhere now.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I discover Half Life and Counter-Strike. I am not as good as I used to
be, back in the days of Quake Multiplayer. But I have fun for quite a
long while.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Not knowing what to do, one of the women I… well, ‘stalk’, gets the help
of one of her more confident and aggresive `friends`_ to either scare me
off or distract me. We start dating.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

My parents aren’t exactly pleased; having had *no* experience in dating
or what to do or behave, I screw up introducing her, among other things.
The mistake takes years to rectify.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I am 19 years old.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

2002: 3 years ago.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I have been in London barely four months, and my girlfriend calls and
shatters my world. I don’t recover for a long time, but the aftermath
leaves us stronger.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I have really long hair now. It reaches below my shoulder, and is the
envy of hippies all around.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I’m beginning to doubt what I want to do for the rest of my life.
Programming and computing science doesn’t seem as attractive as it used
to.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Homesickness takes its toll. I’m beginning to realize, outcast that I
believed I was, nothing compared to the sense of alienation I felt when
I am alone here.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

The isolation, doubt, and homesickness eventually will cost me my degree
here.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Thanks to the urging of my friends, I begin blogging `here`_. It was for
friends, and was very sporadic. It will eventually die from lack of
support, and a few HTML comments-based bugs.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I am 21 years old.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

2004: Last year.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I come back, after two years of trying. Sometimes people need to go away
to realize what they’ve already got.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I start a `LiveJournal`_, mainly to keep in touch with friends who use
this service.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

`Why Are You Here?`_ comes to life. It doesn’t get at all regularly
updated, disappointing people for some damn reason.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

This is a time of relearning—I re-enrol to `HELP`_ and major in Business
Information Systems. I begin feeling some degree of reverse culture
shock, which is a shock in itself.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Hani and I spend more time together, getting a feel of each other after
two years of no physical presence. She introduces me to bloggers. I get
along great with a some of them.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I do something I’ve always fantasized about, but thought I’d never do.
It’s fun, but exposes me to feelings that I never thought I’d feel from
doing it. A couple more incidents like it, and that’s it.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

My `first birthday at home`_ in two years is held in a Swedish Pizza
parlor.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I am 23 years old.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

2005: This year.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I graduate this year, with Second Class Upper Honours. My parents are
understandably very proud. So is Hani.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I start looking for work, and I eventually find it. It’s a change from
being a student.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I break the news to my parents, who are understandably upset and taken
aback by my decision. Much negotiating begins, and the rest of my family
becomes privy to something I have kept secret for almost half a decade.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

My sister grinned and gave me the thumbs-up when she found out I had
done the deed.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I call my brother, who is in Australia. We both talk. He expresses
concern, and asks me if I think it’s a good idea. I say it is. He wishes
me good luck.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I’m looking forward to Christmas.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I am 24 years old.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

2006: Next year.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Performance Review Time. I get past that particular hurdle, and another
stage of my life begins.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Another major event the middle of this year. It’s a frightening
prospect, but I look forward to it. Probably more than some people,
though…

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I am 25 years old.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

2015: Ten years from now.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

“Daddy, what are you thinking about?”

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Oh, nothing, kiddo.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

   </p>

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Well, that’s that. So now, I’m tagging…

.. raw:: html

   </p>

-  `Hani`_ (which she’s done, `but not on her blog`_).
-  `Jordan`_ (he done been `tagged`_)
-  `Ash`_
-  `Jay`_
-  [STRIKEOUT:`Sashi`_] Well, `he did it already`_.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

And, for the hell of it, these people:

.. raw:: html

   </p>

-  `Rajan`_ (or, once you read what he's written, “\ `My Descent Into
   Alcoholism, Drug Addiction, and Eventual Starvation`_\ ”.
-  `MENJ`_
-  `Aminuddin`_.

.. raw:: html

Feel free to take it up, if you’d like. It’s a free-ish country.
