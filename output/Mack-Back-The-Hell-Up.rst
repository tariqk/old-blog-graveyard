I mean, really. `Just back the hell up`_.

I don’t disagree with what he says, no, at least the core message—what
goodman did was wrong, he shouldn’t be abusing freedom of speech the way
he is, if you shit on someone else’s lawn you deserve at very least a
tight slap and at the very most legal proceedings.

But the minute he started bringing up Nazis my wank sense started…
tingling…!

Mack, here’s what I think you did wrong:

You Broke `Godwin’s Law`_.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Actually, you didn’t; your argument instead matched the observation that
is postulated in Godwin’s Law. But that’s not as catchy as saying that
you broke it.

   </p>

Not that you’re not supposed to, mind you—but remember what Godwin’s Law
is supposed to do:

    [Godwin’s Law]’s memetic function is not to end discussions (or even
    to classify them as “old”), but to make participants in a discussion
    more aware of whether a comparison to Nazis or Hitler is
    appropriate, or is simply a rhetorical overreach.

Your argument was a rhetorical over-reach. The Nazi’s *murdered* 6
million Jews. Racists in our country have not yet killed anything close
to that number. Neither are they in power the way the Nazis were, and
neither did they dominate the nations the Aryans did.

The Nazis are semiotic poison. Unless the groups that are being compared
to them bear more than just a passing resemblence to Nazis and Naziism,
or are as virulent as the Nazis, avoid using them in comparisons.

You Went For the Groin.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Seriously. While ad-hominem attacks are generally *de rigueur* in
situations like this, implying that goodman’s arguments are the results
of insanity diminishes the whole edifice of people who *do* have a
grieviance, however imagined, against Malays.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I’m Malay, with Chinese, Javanese and Indian blood in my veins. I can’t
claim to be as *rojak* as you, but you *do* know that non-Malays have a
legitimate grieviance.

And, to top it off, you called him a pathological liar. That’s `wank`_
material there.
