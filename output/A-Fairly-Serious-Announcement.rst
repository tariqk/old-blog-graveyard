Right. I’ve got something important to say.

Most of you know about me and `Hani`_. For those who don’t, we’ve been
dating for five years, which is a decent chunk of time to date before
taking any kind of next step.

Well, guess what. We *are* taking the next step. Hani and I are getting
married.

   </p>

Both our parents know, and have already began planning for the event
already. I’m not sorry to say this at all, but it’s going to be
invite-only—there are too many people who may want to come, and frankly,
it devolving into a circus is the *last* thing I want.

   </p>

But the dates? Well, we’re both getting engaged by the end of this year,
and we’re hoping to tie the knot by the middle of next year. We *may*
post dates. I’m betting that Hani wants to post photos—frankly I shan’t
stop her, though I must wonder why we must submit you lot to the
indignity of me in a *pelamin*, but that’s the way things go.

   </p>

And yes, some of you will get invites. No, I haven’t thought of who yet.
I will.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

That is all. For now.
