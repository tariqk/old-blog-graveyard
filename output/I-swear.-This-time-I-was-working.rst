I'm too *canggih*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With apologies to Right Said Fred

| I'm too *canggih* for my owner
| too *canggih* for my owner
| my owner doesn't use me

| I'm too *canggih* for my package
| too *canggih* for my package
| so *canggih* it's a cage

| I'm too *canggih* for Bangsar
| too *canggih* for Bangsar
| MSC and Putrajaya

| And I'm too *canggih* for the Internet
| too *canggih* for the Internet
| no way I'm synchronizing

**Chorus:**

| I'm a cellphone you know what I mean
| and I make a bloody dent in your wallet
| in your wallet
| yeah in your wallet
| yeah I make a bloody dent in your wallet

| I'm too *canggih* for your brain
| too *canggih* for your brain
| I could drive you insane

| And I'm too *canggih* for your ‘lah’
| too *canggih* for your ‘lah’
| your 'lah' makes me ‘lelah’

**Chorus: (x2)**

| I'm a cellphone you know what I mean
| and I make a bloody dent in your wallet
| in your wallet
| yeah in your wallet
| and I shake in Silent Mode by your wallet

| I'm too *canggih* for Datuk
| too *canggih* for Datuk
| poor Datuk, and Datuk's staff!

| I'm too *canggih* for my owner
| too *canggih* for my owner
| my owner doesn't use me

And I'm too *canggih* for this blog.
