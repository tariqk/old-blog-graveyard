    The Earth is degenerating today. Bribery and corruption abound.
    Children no longer obey their parents, every man wants to write a
    book, and it is evident that the end of the world is fast
    approaching.

It's amazing how common this sentiment seems to apply to history,
especially recent history. As anyone above a certain age can attest, the
world is no longer firmly in our control. Our children rebel against us,
and one's right to voice an opinion has been used and abused so often
that the meaning of our words has lost its meaning and potency.

We are, as it were, approaching the End Times, where the world will
change beyond our recognition, and our lives may be altered or perhaps
ended forever and ever. And there is little we can do to save ourselves.
The integrity of the people above and around us has degenerated in such
a way that any change, any *positive* change, is all but impossible.

We are, in a sense, doomed. Incidentally, have you guessed where the
source of that quote was from?

Well, apparently it was found in an Assyrian tablet, dated circa 2800
BCE. Of course, I've heard people saying that a particular piece of
grafitti in Pompeii is similar to the above quote, so you never know.
