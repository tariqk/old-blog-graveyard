I’m not a hardcore gamer.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I don’t think I ever was, really, when you get down to it. When my
brother and I were younger, we’d compete on videogames, and I invariably
lost most of the time. I never had what it took to win, and that lack of
winning spirit always ensured that I always ended up on the losing side
of any competitive endeavour.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I wasn’t hard enough. I was a pussy, soft, a carebear, a sopping wet
vagina doomed to a life of being screwed over by dicks. In other words,
a loser, a big socialist pinko, a liberal tree-hugging hippie.

Fear and Self-Loathing In Petaling Jaya
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I didn’t exactly understand it myself, honestly—it was either a
combination of a disinclination or an inability to optimize, to plan the
perfect solution, or just to *see* The Thing One Must Do. It was my
biggest weakness, and frankly, it still is.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I liked taking my time, I liked hanging around, I liked spending my time
immersed in something comforting, like an overgrown baby missing the
comfort of his womb. And I generally hated myself for it.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Look at that. You’d never guess by the way that sentence was arranged,
with its wishy-washy qualifier and neutral, conversational tone, of the
depth of loathing I had for that failing.

Those Damn Gamers.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   </p>

So it didn’t really surprise me when I saw this over at `the Escapist`_:

    I believe the seemingly endless popularity of these particular
    games, in which players take the role of soldiers, spies and other
    enforcers of government policy, can be attributed to the inherent
    appeal of a particular ideology. The practical implementation of
    this ideology can include myriad bureaucratic and cultural details
    but whose fundamental appeal to the human animal comes down to the
    notion that might makes right.

The Essential Division
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

When you get down to it, the pure mechanics of gaming is about one
thing: who wins. There is no room for losers or the honorable in a
game—only a winner and the chumps.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

You can lie to yourself about the honor of sportsmanship, you can blind
yourself to optimal strategies with your misguided injunctions against
manipulating and exploiting your fellow man, but all that that allows
you, in the end, is a sense of comfort before someone without your
delusions comes by and eats you alive.

Pray That Isn’t As Simple As That
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I hope to dear God that games aren’t like real life, and so far evidence
is supporting my claim. Society, frankly, is inefficient. Trains do not,
in general, run in time. You are not, one hopes, an expendable cog in a
machine. You can still express yourself with relative impunity. Might,
for now, does not make right.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Because god help you if it did:

    A friend of mine studied political science at Yale. In one class,
    the professor posted a game scenario: You are the newly empowered
    dictator of a third-world country. Your people face famine, plague,
    poverty and unrest. What policies would you enact to solve these
    problems? (Fans of Tropico, you know how this works.) My friend’s
    solution? Death camps. Round up the sick, the lame, the infertile,
    the ignorant, the useless, the unproductive and execute them. Bring
    the workforce and the job market into sudden alignment. Reconcile
    the mouths to feed with the supplies of food.

Nature Brown In Rust And Dried Blood
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

If this sort of strategy worked, even once, it would have spawned a
state far more successful than any other, and by the Darwin’s laws of
evolution it would have replaced all other states. Death camps would
have been the norm.

Instead we have this tangled, paltry mess.

A Nasty, Vicious Theory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I have a theory. It’s a nasty, vicious theory, and it goes against my
somewhat (ha, pussy!) liberal leanings. It goes on like this:

.. raw:: html

   </p>

`Jack Thompson`_ is a lunatic, but a lunatic with a point.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

He talks about games being murder simulators and trainers for a new
generation of psychopaths. It’s completely batshit, but perhaps it has a
grain of truth. Perhaps games don’t train psychopaths, but instead cause
gamers to self-select; the ones with the winning drive go to the top,
and the ones without it lose and eventually give up.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Don’t Stop Them Playing!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Maybe that’s all there is to gaming, and the best players are those with
no clear scruples: people who would, without blinking an eye, `defraud
fellow players of approximately 16,000 US dollars of in-game
property`_... and then `brag about it later`_, justifying their actions
as being completely within the rules of the game.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Maybe the best thing we can do to prevent a generation of psychopaths
and sociopaths from taking advantage of people again is to not take
these games away. Design a game that will optimize the selection of
psychopaths and sociopaths, latent and obvious. And then, *force*
everyone to play them. With each other.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Why? Because then, the best, the nastiest, the most vicious will
possibly be the most successful people in that game, and you’ll know who
they are by their performance.

That Won’t Work This Time, Buddy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

No point hiding behind complex layers of manipulation. No point behind
trying to fool a battery of psychiatrists. No point in suppressing their
desires, because there they’ll be, out there in the open, in the top ten
rankings.

    We gamers have had the training. We’ve learned the mindset. We know
    the score. We are efficient, deadly, methodical. If only we were in
    charge – then, oh then, we could show the world how much we care
    about it.

    .. raw:: html

       </p>

    .. raw:: html

       <p>

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Maybe if we knew who these people were, we could stop them before they
get their hands on other people’s lives and cause some *real* damage.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I mean, who wouldn’t want to take down the next reptile-brained,
psychotic maniac before he sinks his teeth into people’s lives and
*really* cause some hurt?
