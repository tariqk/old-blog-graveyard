The Great Malaysian Blackout.

I was in Kinokuniya KLCC when the lights failed.

It started when the lights flickered, while I was looking for a travel
book (it was an errand for someone). I had found my book the minute the
lights failed.

At first I thought it was, just, you know, a normal power outage â€” one
shop, or a part of the building at most. Turns out that the whole
building was out.

As I took a cab back to Bangsar (I had learned not to park in Suria
KLCC's car parks on weekdays the hard way), I realized that I was in
what seemed like a city-wide blackout. Wow. We haven't had one of those
since Paka.

On my way to Bangsar, I observed that the amount of pedestrians had
doubled. Figures. KL is a city built on air-conditioning and artificial
lighting. The minute the lights and artificial ventilation failed, no
one could be persuaded to stay in their offices as their cubicles become
dark, stuffy hothouses.

When I *did* get back to Bangsar (after paying an exorbitant fee for a
fare ride, and sitting through a massive jam at Jalan Bangsar), I
settled into my car and drove back home.

*That* took a while. The roads, thanks to the screwed-up traffic lights
and general disorder, were clogged with vehicles. Spent a good part of
an hour stuck in what was only a few hundred metres of road, near the
Rothmans roundabout.

Lucky for me, at least the MacDonalds drive-thru I went to had power,
and PJ, for the most part, still has electricity. The power outage,
though extensive, didn't touch `Hitz`_, `Mix`_, `Light and Easy`_ or
Radio 4 KL. It got `RED 104.9`_ for a while, though. Pity. I kinda liked
them.

They're back now. And I'm home. Saw the Wan (my maid) waiting outside,
in vain, for a bus. Told her what happened, and she was surprised and
peeved off, to say the least. She wanted to go to Ampang today. Anyway.
Will take her tonight, if I have to.

Oh, well. That's it.
