This is an angry rant. If you don’t like it, leave. If you want to talk
about it, leave. If you don’t like that, you know what to do.

I’m a Muslim.

Being a Muslim isn’t *just* the intellectual acceptance of what I
believe—I leave that to other people, really. It’s not *just* me growing
up a Muslim—but sure, that played a part. I’m a Muslim because that is
my identity. Body, heart, mind and soul, that’s who I am, and I suspect
a significant portion of Malaysian-Muslims are like this, but don’t care
to admit it.

Too Much Time On The Net Is Bad For You.

And I go on the Internet. It strikes me how ironic these two ideas can
be, especially when you consider this:

There isn’t a lot of criticism about Islam for Malaysians IRL. It simply
isn’t allowed, mainly because of hypocritical bullshit about avoiding
racial disunity. Yeah, it’s hypocritical, especially when you hear those
fucking xenophobes you call UMNO Youth rant. Bullshit racial disunity.
We’re pussies about criticism, fellow Malay-Muslims. Face facts.

The Great Muslim Shock.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because I’ve been on the ‘net for seven years and I still can’t get over
the Islamaphobic bigoted shit that keeps cropping up. Significant
portions of it are dressed up as if they’re the voice of *reason* and
*civilization*.

The worst part about all this shit is how it attacks *Islam*. I mean,
it’s hard enough to deal with shit when your own *belief system* gets
treated like a fucking pathogenic meme.

Pathogenic meme?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It’s *not*, fuckers! I don’t see people other than certified nutjobs say
that Catholicism is responsible for the actions of the IRA or that
fundamentalist Judaism is responsible for Palestinian
oppression\ :sup:``1`_`.

I don’t need to drag out the reasons why Islam is not “inherently
violent”. Most of the *1.1 billion people who profess to that religion*,
some of them living, like, *next door to you*, go through most of their
goddamned *lives* without a single violent impulse in their head. Or, if
they do, they deal with it *the way you do*. Some of these self-same
people are *religious*. *Traditionalist religious*. You don’t have to be
liberal to be peaceful.

What Do You Want, The Moon?

Are you saying that that’s not enough for you? Well, then, *fuck you*.
Go fuck yourself, you pansy-waist armchair
crusader-academic-or-general-manque. I’ve had enough of your
pontificating. I’m *sick* of it. Pontificate by your fucking self.
Assholes.

There is no room for discussion. Feel free to send an email whining
about how I’m oppressing you by shutting comments down.

:sup:`1` But then again that’s what Pusat Islam always says during
Friday sermons. But shit, you want to listen to *Pusat Islam* for an
unbiased view of global events?
