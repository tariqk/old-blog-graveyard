    And yet, though the US Declaration of Independence speaks of “a
    decent respect to the opinions of mankind”, you don't, of course,

    contributions are outlawed. And you're unlikely to have the chance
    to do any campaigning on the ground. All you can do is wait and
    watch: you're powerless.
