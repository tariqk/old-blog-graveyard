Noticed that I didn't want the Blogger icon on my blog. Not that I
disliked it, no, no. I just didn't think it suited the blog.

So I've got a new `favicon`_. Used `IrfanView`_ and The Photo. Crop,
crop, resample, add border, add border again, done. Not that big a deal
to make, actually.

**Edited**: How interesting. It doesn't work with IE.
