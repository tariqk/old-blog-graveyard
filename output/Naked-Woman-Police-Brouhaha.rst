I heard the `news`_. And worse still, later on, I saw a `series of
stills`_ that purpotively capture the act, as it is, with its pants
down. There is, predictably, `even commentary`_ `about the`_ `whole
issue`_.

I’m going to take the best-case scenario and assume the video is fake.
Not because I believe it is, or I want to believe that it is (quite the
opposite, actually), but I want to show you how effective my argument
is, even if the video was proven to be fake.

Malaysians And The Law.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Malaysians have an interesting relationship with the law. The best way
we can describe it is, very probably, “If we can ignore it we will.”
We’re not very law abiding—pirated goods still sell pretty strong,
traffic laws are mostly optional, and generally we’re free to do what we
like so long as we pay the monetary price.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

It isn’t exactly cynicism, really. Take a look at the news, and you
might suddenly realize that if you do have the money and the right
connections, you might even get away with murder. Allegedly.

What, Us?
~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Is there something wrong with us? Some fundamental flaw that makes us
incapable of following the law, either through the letter or its spirit?
Are Malaysians, genetically, incapable of following the law?

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I don’t really think so. Part of it lies with the impression we get from
the news—that yes, if you’re clever enough, and if you’re subtle enough,
you *can* escape from anything, on a technicality and public prosecutor
incompetence. Crime doesn’t get punished here, not really.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

The other reason, the one I’ll be going to at length, is our
relationship with the police.

Bad Boys Bad Boys…
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

The police have been trying to get people to trust on them more for the
past few years. You’ve seen the posters and signs—“Rakan COP”, and the
like. They’ve been trying to bring the message that the Royal Malaysian
Police are competent, transparent, and especially, especially, `don’t
fucking doubt it or we’ll fucking sue you, bitch`_, not corrupt.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

They’re not succeeding. Partly because, hey, the aren’t exactly
competent, transparent and not corrupt, but the solution to that one is
particularly obvious—stop being incompetent, not transparent and
corrupt. The second reason is a little harder to deal with, and involves
a paradigm shift not only in the RMP, but in Malaysian society in
general.

What ‘choo Gonna Do When They Come For You?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

The police force owes a lot to the Communist Insurgency. When you have
an insurgency, folks, your police force needs to be good at several
things to enforce the law. One of these things is that you start getting
good at—specializing in, even—controlling the populace by fear.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

You’ve got to give credit where credit is due, of course—the police are
*amazingly* skilled in some things. If you want someone to handle riot
control, you really can do much worse than Malaysian police. If you want
checkpoints, same thing. Ditto suppressing terrorism and the like. Our
cops are just *that* good\ :sup:``1`_`.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

The problem is, the *real* problem behind all of this is that they
haven’t moved with the times.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Cops, Actually.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

If anything, what I loved the most about my time overseas was to see a
different relationship between the police and the local community.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

The `police in the London Metropolitan area`_ don’t, let’s face it, have
an `awesome reputation`_ either. They shot some kid dead without due
process, didn’t they? But the fact was, they responded well. The London
community *trusts* the police to a degree, and the police find that
their work in enforcement is a lot easier.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Yeah, it *is* actually easier to obey the law when you know that the
police are on our side. It stops being a matter of lawbreaking being
something you do to “stick it up to the man” and more that lawbreaking
becomes something that goes against your interest in the end.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Bad Attitude
~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

It boils down in the end to our attitude towards the law. The law,
imposed by an external force, is a burden. But the minute a society
realizes, or is made to realize, that obeying the law, *all the time* is
to their best interests, they do. This isn’t foolish optimism—the idea
in itself is based on Skinnerian psychology. Rewards *are* better than
punishment.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

It’s something that not only our police fail to understand. The music
industry here fails to understand that as well, with their campaign
against media piracy. It is pointless to try the legalistic argument in
Malaysia—no one trusts or necessarily obeys the law.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Who cares if it’s fake?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Who cares if the video is fake? The fact is, the video is seen as
conforming to our view of what policemen do. You may have, no doubt,
heard some stories. They don’t exactly protect and serve in those tales,
do they?

.. raw:: html

   </p>

The thought of cooperating to the police for your own good is alien to
the mind of many Malaysians. What we do instead is cooperate because of
fear of greater punishment.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

What kind of incentive is that?

:sup:`1` Or maybe not, if you hear rumors about how we’re supposedly the
terrorist hub in the region. We might actually be, you know.
