What I find amusing is that a Malaysian government department has not

(that's business as usual, isn't it?), but it has *engaged in criminal
activity*.

Well, copyright infringement is criminal activity, isn't it? Or wait,
that only applies to piracy, right. What we're talking about here is
*plagiarism*.
