I haven't been on the Internet for a while now.

Oh, I've been *online*. I've been literally connected to the Internet,
and I've been working, and that requires Internet access.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

But I haven't been *on* for a while. Not really. Not long enough to
remember to catch up on stuff. Not to read my emails. Not to blog. Just
been on. That's all.

It's been a stressful two months, is all.

I figure no one really misses me that much, so it shouldn't be a big
deal. It's not as if I'm, oh, I don't know, `Jordan`_ or `Pick Yin`_ or
`Ash`_ or `Jeff Ooi`_ or `Dina`_. Normal lah. Blogger kecik. We pop in
and out all the time.

Though I'm beginning to think that maybe it's time I should work on
something new, especially since this page has been standing still for a
while. I've been blogging, but not really thinking of where I wanna go.
So maybe I should.

Structure is good.
