I've got news for you, 'cause I've Noticed Something Disturbing about
The `Great`_ `Men`_ of Malaysian Bloggers.

For Men of Great Stature, these guys sure `cry`_ a `lot`_.

I mean, seriously. Sure, corruption is vexing and upsetting, and sure,
stupid brutality is brutal and, well, stupid. But weeping? You'd think
they'd all do a Kassim Selamat by now, by the amount of tears they shed.

Really, feeling sad and down about it, or engaging in an act of public
ululation to jolt the Malaysian public consciousness to do something isâ€¦
well, it's an acceptable trick. We all do it, especially if 1) The
republicans won the damn election again 2) They've banned gay marriage
yet again 3) another cult TV show gets axed by greedy network executives
again or 4) some other tragedy of public conscience happens yet again.

But that's the thing, see. It's a gimmick. A *trick*. If you must think
of blogging as an art (please do, being the bastard demi-nephew of
journalism is odious), then think of the whole weeping for your country
for your countrymen, for your peers, for your profession as a stylistic
device.

Sometimes you get mad. Sometimes you point and laugh. Sometimes you
respond with weary cynicism. And yes, sometimes you cry.

Weeping for your nation once in a while marks you as a serious, intense
visionary with high ideals. Doing it dozens of times makes you a drama
queen, and people will be hard-pressed to treat you seriously.

So please. In moderation. Vary your devices. We don't necessarily want
to see the same old crap over and over again.
