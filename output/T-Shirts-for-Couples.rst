Malaysians can be so insensitive sometimes.

It's bad enough that `Hani`_ gets stared at by Malay men (who have *not*
learned the art of sneaking a look), but people like `the Scarfer`_ and
`Jordan`_ have to go through the sort of derisive howling that Our
Enlightened Countrymen seem to love to subject on apparently ‘morally
deficient’ people.

Jordan put up a pretty interesting idea, actually. Get t-shirts to
remind other people that the both of you are legally married couples,
and that actions like holding hands and displaying affection are
perfectly all right. Which just got me thinking…

Why not get a set of t-shirts for the non-Normal, non-Optimal Malaysian
couple? Please note that the terms Normal and Optimal are used
sarcastically, which means that it's for couples that don't look like
the normal sheep Malaysian couples tend to look like. These are for the
*freaks* that deign to *walk* the same streets with the Normals.

Anyway:

-  A couple t-shirt, with the words, “DAH KAHWIN LAH” in the front, and
   “WE'RE MARRIED LAH” in the back. (`From Jordan's Blog`_).
-  A baby t-shirt with the words “STOP STARING” or “APA TENGOK?”, right
   across the chest.
-  For guys: “YES, YOUR WIFE LOOKS PRETTY GOOD TOO”.

-  A couple t-shirt that says “MARRIED FOR LOVE, NOT FOR GREEN CARD”.

I dunno. They look pretty lame on paper. I wonder how well they'd do.
