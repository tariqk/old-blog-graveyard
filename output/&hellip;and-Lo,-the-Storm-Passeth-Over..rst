I've been ill for the past three days or so.

It started off as a minor cold, with sneezing and the like. It felt like
hay-fever, but there were no watery eyes and it wasn't so bad. I had a
sore throat, though. That worried me.

It got really bad last night. I think I lost some of the contents of my
sahur, because my system started rebelling at the racking coughs I ended
up getting, and it all ended when I threw up twice that night.

The worst seems to be over, though -- I'm pretty sure. Today everything
feels like it's covered in a golden light, and I feel like a kid again,
alone, fresh and fragile, but still there. It helps that it's a nice
day.

I guess a day off wouldn't be so bad, after all.
