For the past week or so, I've felt disoriented, confused and blind, as
my mind, already numbed with long inactivity, struggled to readjust into
new projects, new subjects and new deadlines.

Today, for the first time, I felt the Rush.

I don't trust the Rush when it happens. By experience I know the feeling
is transitory, and the emotions associated with the Rush are very often
misleading. It has caused me to overestimate my ability, overextend
myself, and generally cause grief.

So it's not something to be trusted. But it's welcome, because it means
that it's already started.
