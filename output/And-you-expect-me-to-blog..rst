I haven't written a thing for a while.

Call it blogger's block, call it anything you like -- hell, call it
Steven if you have to. I haven't written a thing for a while.

   </p>

I could name any number of sources for the lack of updates -- massive
holiday blues. The Tsunami. The whole [STRIKEOUT:blogosphere] blogging
community up in arms over something-or-other. The fact that I've been
more interested in *layan*\ ing [STRIKEOUT:Hani] The Sims 2.

   </p>

End result: No blog updates. [STRIKEOUT:People] Hani asking me when I'll
update my blog. General malaise.

Now Hani looking over my bloody shoulder and eating a packet of crisps
go away don't I not bother you when I fucking blog, you nosy woman??

No. Off. Get your hands off my keyboard. Away. *Avast*!

Argh.
