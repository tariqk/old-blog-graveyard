Your Life Was Never Your Own

Ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure that I announce to you
all that I am a faker.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

A fraud. A prevaricator. Someone who projects a face across an
impersonal medium. A charlatan, a poseur; One Who Is Not Truly Himself.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

My admission of guilt, and horrible guilt it is, comes from the
realization that I have never been true to myself on this blog. I have
never been true to myself, and will never be true to myself; not here.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

You want to know the shocking thing? I never meant it to be in the first
place.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Oh, you look at poor `Minishorts`_, and her `wondering where her private
space went`_. Or to `mrbrown`_, who posted something about `how
potential employers now use blogs as an assessment tools`_. Oh, woe!
Where hath the blog, the private space where we pour our hearts, gone?

.. raw:: html

   </p>

It was never there, children. You just pretended that it existed, when
in truth all the world did was pretend that your little place didn't,
and ignored you.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

But that's not true any more, is it?

.. raw:: html

   </p>

You ever wonder why `Jeff`_ never talks about his life? Or why all
`Mack`_ does is talk about the actions of others, only representing
himself as a detached observer, even in `the most poignant of moments`_?

.. raw:: html

   </p>

That's because they know, kiddies. Tie yourself to your blog and you tie
yourself to a potential anchor.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I had to learn the lesson kinda the hard way, but I learnt it, as all
bloggers eventually do. But instead of mourning the loss of a private
den to kvetch away, I made my own.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

It lives in a little place called `LiveJournal`_ â€” a placed scorned by
many of the cognoscetti of the Digital Realm. It's a place of losers,
they cry. Emo boys and goth girls writing shit poetry and whining about
how dire their jobs in Hot Topic are! No self-respecting entity goes
there! Even *`Google`_* avoids it!

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Exactly. And LJ provides the technological tools to limit participation
and viewership. Notice how I *never*, *ever* talk about my opinions
about my workplace and my colleagues. Where do you think it goes? Go
ahead and `take a look`_, you won't find anything incriminating apart
from extremely fanboyish stuff.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Unless I *trusted* you.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Bloggers, do not mourn. You want a private space? Find one. Make one.
Make an effort at it. Get your friends, *people you trust* to join the
service if you want to spill your heart to them occasionally. Whatever.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Don't come whining to us about how hard it is to keep your private life,
well, private.

Of course it isn't private. You fucking blog it.
