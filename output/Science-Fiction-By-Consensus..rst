Been wanting to write about this for a while, but I guess I never got
the nerve to do so. It's basically about this:

.. raw:: html

`Orion's Arm: Building a World, 10,000 Years in the Future`_.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Okay, so what about it? Orion's Arm is a community dedicated to building
a realistic, plausible universe, with a vast setting with *no humanoid
aliens whatsover*.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

…

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Wait. Why is that *important*, all of the sudden? I mean, yes, there is
no reasonable explanation for why there are Vulcans and Twi'leks and any
kind of humanoid variant, but is that necessarily a prime selling point
for this kind of thing? I mean, seriously. Are there enough people out
there who are so sick and tired at looking at an alien with the shape
(if not the exact physiology) of a human that there's a market for it?

.. raw:: html

   </p>

That's my first niggle for the whole world, or at least the attitude and
beliefs behind the group of people who are doing this. It kinda surfaces
every once in a while, despite the fact that this worldbuilding exercise
is actually pretty fucking brilliant.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

The basic premise, if you haven't visited that place yet, is actually
pretty much like this:

    .. raw:: html

       </p>

    The original idea for the series began with `M. Alan Kazlev`_, the
    ‘Director’ for the OA franchise. He likes space opera, but he
    doesn't like what the OA community calls ‘sillytech’. Not that I
    blame him, but since I'm not much of a stickler for sf I don't mind
    it as much as he does, apparently.

    .. raw:: html

       </p>

    So what he does, basically, is try to write a story. It's an sf
    tale, at any rate, but with one big difference: it's space opera
    *and* hard sf. Which is harder than it looks, to be perfectly
    honest, since space opera is more concerned with the form and
    struggle between good and evil (or less-evil and evil), while hard
    sf is concerned with more scientific realism and coherence. These
    two goals typically clash.

    .. raw:: html

       </p>

    When you try and mix those two elements with the `Singularity`_
    idea, you usually give up, since Singularity stories typically end
    with everyone entering a vast, blissful rapture. Alan, funnily
    enough, solved it, by not making Singularity the all-encompassing,
    end-of-everything route. What happens, in the end, is, perhaps
    ironically, the rebirth of the Gods.

    .. raw:: html

       </p>

    Oh, and I didn't mention this, but halfway through this whole
    process he lost control over the whole story, and it kinda ballooned
    into the current state that it's in -- from one novel to a whole
    frickin' community-built *world*.

    .. raw:: html

       </p>

    .. raw:: html

       <p>

   </p>

I have mixed feelings over the whole franchise, really. I mean, it's
really cool. Really, it is. Ideas like a `species of gods`_ ruling the
galaxy to answering the question of what happens to old-world religions,
like `Islam`_, to `technology`_ `smaller`_ `and`_ `more`_ `advanced`_
than nanotech make me go ‘ding’. They're great ideas. They're pretty
original ideas. Plus, they're under the `CC`_, so that means that people
can use it to a limited extent.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

But if anything, a good franchise cannot depend on great ideas. There
are thousands of series and novels out there with great ideas but poor
execution, and that just ruins it all for a lot of people. I mean, I
don't agree with a lot of the basic ideas behind *Orion's Arm* -- not
things like why FTL travel and the existence of humanoid aliens (which
there are, only that they're not really aliens, they're humans modified
over thousands of years of evolution and tweaking), but basic ideas on
why you're doing this.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I mean, you can say that there are no humanoid aliens because you think
they're old hat, sure… but you need to realize what those aliens were
for originally. Those aliens filled niches that fleshed out a world
where all of humanity was united as one, and you needed that to make the
world seem deeper and realer than it would have been without them. And
ideas like FTL and sillytech are there for a reason, too -- they make
the story epic without having to make the story over-complicated. Take
away those things, and you need other things to compensate.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

And in a sense, Orion's Arm does this. It does, but only unconsciously,
out of habit, or by discovering that you can't really make an engaging
tale about an AI God last more than a short story. You don't talk about
humanoid aliens, you talk about `vec`_, `ai`_, `splice`_, `su`_,
`tweak`_ and `sybont`_ allies and foes, which, incidentally, make for
more interesting tales than some all American cast taking on some damn
Vulcans, even if you're using those characters the same way. There's
plenty of shit that don't get used because everyone seems to be focusing
on the wrong things… and *not* on what makes a better story / game /
whatever.

I like OA. I wouldn't mind contributing, myself. But the inherent
wankiness of the community makes me hesitate; it's not something I want
to deal with on a regular basis.
