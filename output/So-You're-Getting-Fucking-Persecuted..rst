So You're Getting Fucking Persecuted.

There was once a time when `Jeff`_ `called`_ me contrarian\ :sup:``1`_`.
I was flattered\ :sup:``2`_`! And then people forgot forgot me and I had
to abandon my plan to make money of blogging, and instead get a real
actual job. That sorta sucks.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Serves me right for not being regular. I wonder if bloggers have their
own kind of bran.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Anyway! Enough reminiscing. We’re here to talk about the Freedom of
Speech!

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Getting Started / Get Retarded
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Yes, it’s a post referencing `that`_ `event`_!

.. raw:: html

   </p>

First off. It’s interesting to note that while there’s a lot of reacting
to what happened in the news, I didn’t actually *see* what those two
forumgoers posted, so I have no idea if *what* they said was racist or
not.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Secondly, *assuming*, of course, that the statements made by the two
defendants *were* actually racist in nature, then all I’ve got to say,
again, assuming that what they said was racist, is that those they had
it coming.

Being Harsh On The Ones You [STRIKEOUT:Love] Mildly Dislike
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I’ve never been very kind to my fellow bloggers. I’ve heckled them,
mocked them, belittled them and, in general, challenged them to actually
*prove* that what they say is important in the general scheme of things.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

My argument is that blogs are intrinsicly uninteresting—dull, even
plebian and horrible at times. You get what you pay for in terms of low
cost of ownership, and sometimes you may get overcharged.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Quality Oxymorons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Nothing gives you the *right* to be important, least of all being a
blogger. Most of us will be trapped in the personal limbo of being
uninteresting to all but the closest and most obsessive of our
readership, while a select few will get to be the next `Kottke`_ or
`Ooi`_, or whoever it is that is popular.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

While being read and respected by thousands is nice, it certainly helps
to realize that while Jeff gets another fucking award from yet another
international organization and Kottke gets his six billionth reader, you
and I will be filling up what we can charitably call `Sturgeon’s Bottom
Ninety Percent`_.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

If you’re still dreaming about making it to the big-time by blogging,
get over it.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

That ‘Fundamental Right’
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

And then there’s the ‘fundamental inalieable right to Free Speech’.
While many people focus on the right to say whatever you like without
fear of censorship, I say “bullshit”.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Freedom of Speech means freedom of living to the consequences of what
you say. While you can say what you like online, you’re never, *never*
free from consequence.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

The government may not be able to do a *thing* to you\ :sup:``4`_`, but
that doesn’t mean that what you say can’t get you fired, or get you
verbally slapped around like a two-buck whore online, or cause your
friends or lovers to leave you.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Welcome To The Land of Shut The Fuck Up
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

And so you *do* and *must* censor yourself. You think to yourself, “Can
I say this? Is this right?” before posting your vitriol across the
public wire. Of course you must. Being free to speak doesn’t mean you
are free from being told, in very firm words, to be quiet.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

As a matter of fact, as a Citizen of the Internet, you are allowed to
speak whatever you like. Freedom to speak doesn’t mean that you must be
listened or that your words deserve immortality. You are free to speak.
What happens next is not up to you.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

And frankly, like religious bigotry and outright stupidity, racism is
hardly a defensible thing. You want to get in trouble, get in trouble by
yourself. I’m not defending you, not because I do not care about free
speech, but I have better time defending the right to the free speech of
others who are more deserving.

Footnotes

:sup:`1` And my work eloquently-crafted, but I’m a crafty bugger, and I
can spot a backhanded compliment a mile away!

.. raw:: html

   </p>

:sup:`2` And yes, I know what it means! It means he thinks I’m on
crack\ :sup:``3`_`!

.. raw:: html

   </p>

:sup:`3` Do not deny it, you crafty old bastard! You know it in your
bones to be true!

.. raw:: html

   </p>

:sup:`4` But it *can*, and *did*. Oh dearie me. That’s so unfair!
Whatever shall you *do*?
