That's what I am. I've been wanting to blog for two days, now. I've
wanted to talk about a couple of things â€” violence in videogames and a
roleplaying decision, for one. Thing is, every time I sit in front of my
PC, everything I want to say runs dry. It's very aggravating.

On the fun side, yesterday I was playing around with `Amazon`_'s Wish
List feature, and I've amassed what looks like a veritable fortune in
merchandise I want to buy, but I cannot afford to. Since it takes a
couple of working days for Amazon to index my Wish List, it's still not
publically searchable. I'll post up the link when it is.
