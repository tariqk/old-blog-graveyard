Okay.

I just got back to my computer, and I find that I have six emails, count
them, six emails, from various sources.

One email was a comment confirmation for this particular post. That’s
cool. Nah, `Elizabeth`_, I don’t think `I’d be cut out to be a
columnist`_. The pay sucks, I’d end up getting my posts edited, and I’d
have to run against a deadline, and I *hate* deadlines. I do this for a
hobby, and I’d like to keep it that way. Also, I think `you’re very
pretty`_. Thanks for visiting!

One was from `equalmarriage.ca`_, a website advocating same-sex
marriages, and another four were from `DesiringGod.org`_, apparently a
Christian website that apparently spreads the Word of God (the Christian
one, apparently). Both were attempting to confirm my subcription to
them.

I’m going to assume that it was a honest mistake by someone else who was
named Tariq Kamal who has a gmail account, and I’m letting it slide for
now. I have, however, placed these emails under my ‘Spam’ folder, and
these emails, and future emails like it will go under Spam and will be
summarily ignored and flushed periodically, without them being opened.

Nothing else has changed. Have a nice day.
