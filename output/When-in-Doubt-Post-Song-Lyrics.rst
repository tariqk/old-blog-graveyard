I'll make this quick, since I'm in a hurry.

   </p>

.. raw:: html

   <p>

    .. raw:: html

       </p>

    | Heaven bent to take my hand

    | And lead me through the fire

    | Be the long awaited answer

    To a long and painful fight

    .. raw:: html

       </p>

    | Truth be told I've tried my best

    | But somewhere along the way

    | I got caught up in all there was to offer

    And the cost was so much more than I could bear

    .. raw:: html

       </p>

    | Though I've tried, I've fallen

    | I have sunk so low

    | I'm messed up

    | Better I should know

    | So don't come round here

    And tell me I told you so

    .. raw:: html

       </p>

    | We all begin with good intent

    | Love was raw and young

    | We believed that we could change ourselves

    | The past can be undone

    | But we carry on our backs the burden

    | Time always reveals

    | In the lonely light of morning

    | In the wound that would not heal

    | It's the bitter taste of losing everything

    That I've held so dear

    .. raw:: html

       </p>

    | I've fallen

    | I have sunk so low

    | I'm messed up

    | Better I should know

    | So don't come round here

    And tell me I told you so, [no..]

    .. raw:: html

       </p>

    | Heaven bent to take my hand

    | I have nowhere left to turn

    | I've lost to those I thought were friends

    | To everyone I know

    | Oh they turned their heads embarrassed

    | Pretend that they don't see

    | But it's one missed step

    | You'll slip before you know it

    And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed

    .. raw:: html

       </p>

    | Though I've tried, I've fallen

    | I have sunk so low

    | I'm messed up

    | Better I should know

    | So don't come round here

    | And tell me I told you so, [no..]

    | I'm messed up

    | Better I should know

    | But don't come round here

    And tell me I told you so.

Sums up how I've been feeling, at least.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Take care of yourselves, you filthy sons of camels.
