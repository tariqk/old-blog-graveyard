***WARNING!**: Not for people who find talk about masturbation and the
sight of one huge penis unsettling.*

If you've seen my profile before, you might have noticed that I've added
a few new interests.

One of them was ‘masturbation’. Out of curiosity, I clicked through it,
just to see who else was brave enough to put it in.

Two things I noticed:

#. There seems to be a lot of teen girls who like masturbate on Blogger.
   Youngest I actually saw was 15, which sounds suspicious as hell.
#. Out of all the women in Blogger, only two have posted pictures. Mind,
   not of *themselves*, but just pictures. Basically an `eye`_ and `a
   pair of panties`_. Both of the posters are older than 25.

I don't recommend looking through the profiles myself, unless the sight
of a `huge, erect wang doesn't upset you (and yes, the profile has
pictures that may shock and amaze you, mostly shock)`_.

Why am I telling you this? Well… it's just me thinking about the nature
of the Internet. I suppose telling the world that you like `killing
kittens`_ is a ‘guy thing’, while for girls it's taboo. Unless I'm
completely wrong, of course, and there's a far more reasonable
explanation, like hordes and hordes of guys emailing you and telling you
how hot they think you are—

Oh, wait. `Hani`_ used to get that kind of shit. Okay. Makes sense.
