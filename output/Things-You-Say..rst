Things You Say.

Let's start this particular session with me saying first-hand that I
don't think `Mack`_ is dishonest.

That's off my chest. I don't think his opinions of the latest
`flavor-of-the-week`_ is in any way right, but I just realized that
‘dishonest’ is inaccurate — as a matter of fact, using it is sort of
provocative and confrontational, and not conducive to talking.

On the plus side `he commented on my blog`_. Before anyone starts
passing out the ad hominem attacks, do note that `you're several months
too late`_.

Anyway. So what did I really mean, then, when I commented on his post
about the whole fiasco? Hmm.

I believe, as I still do believe, that he, and a fairly significant
proportion of other bloggers linked and related to the Malaysian and
Singaporean blogosphere, are highlighting the wrong thing.

It was never about the nudity, ladies and gentlemen. Face it, you and I
have access to nude pictures from the Internet on a daily basis. It's
not impossible to find; they've been around since the Internet was able
to carry pictures. Just because the `naked woman :sup:`[NSFW]``_ we see
on the Web could be the same woman we see on the street every day does
not make a difference. She's not brave or unusual — brave or unusual
would have been if she had bared all in the fifties, or the Victorian
Age. Nudity, ladies and gentlemen, is old hat.

What is of concern is that she bared all in a public commons. Sure we
can find pornography on the Web. Sure we can find tasteful nudes on the
Web as well. But before we're allowed to sample the delectable delights,
we must go through a time-honored ritual: the “This Material is For
Consenting Adults Only, No Minors Allowed Past This Point” Page.

It's there for a reason, folks. You use it to warn people who *can't*
take freeform nudity into their consciousness. You use it to warn them
that the thing you're going to see isn't exactly something that isn't
exactly kosher. It separates the border between a public commons and a
private gallery. It informs users about what they see, and gives them a
choice.

It matters not that it isn't art — while I'm sure you can bend the rules
for *`Venus de Milo`_* and *`David`_*, but those are cultural icons.
While the SPG is many things, a cultural icon she isn't yet.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

That's what the press is highlighting. They're not after bloggers this
time, lads and ladettes. They're after a woman who couldn't be bothered
to warn her users that what she's posting may not be palatable to some.
And look at how we're portraying it. Another David and Goliath metaphor?
Aren't you guys *tired* of that same old yarn?

.. raw:: html

   </p>

It's something that crops up every once in a while, in the wonderful
world that is Malaysian blogging. Once in a while, we must find
justification in ourselves and our work by portraying ourselves as
oppressed and marginalized by Daddy Media. Once in a while, that's true.
Not this time.

A blogger made a mistake, and is paying the price. The press plays
unfair because they `reported and editorialized`_? Wow, can they ever do
anything right?

Sometimes things aren't as clear-cut as it may seem.
