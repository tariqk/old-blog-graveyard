I know it's probably gonna make me look *really* lame (since, you know,
I'm not a Goth), but it had to be done. So this is what I sent to `the
Star's Youth section`_:

    I am responding to Ex-Goth Wannabe's 'Clarifying Goths' letter,
    dated September 22nd, which in turn was a response to Candice Chai's
    'Testing a Theory', dated September 15th. Please withhold my real
    name and address from publication.

    I must respectfully state that Ex-Goth Wannabe's purported
    experience and research paints a very stereotypical picture of the
    goth movement, which is more an aesthetic and philosophical ideal
    rather than a subculture of its own. It has ideas, traditions, role
    models and musical influences, but nothing of the monolithic
    features that Ex-Goth Wannabe describes.

    Firstly, a significant number of Goths are depressed and prone to
    melodrama, not because they are hated and despised, but simply
    because of the emotional and philosophical traditions that they
    espouse. These Goths may embrace nihilism as a philosophy, and
    attempt to exemplify ideals like death, darkness and film and
    fictional horror, but those characteristics are not something
    inherent in them; rather, it is a conscious choice. People, as you
    may already have guessed, often react badly to this.

    There are Goths who break this stereotype, known as Perkygoths.
    Despite exemplifying the goth aesthetic, these Goths have a
    light-hearted demeanour. The works of Jhonan Vasquez and Neil
    Gaiman's character Death are examples of this.

    Secondly, while the black fishnet stockings and dark clothing are
    staples of the goth movement, denoting the classical goth look, it
    isn't necessarily the only kind of outfit Goths may wear. Again,
    some subcultures, notably the Cybergoths, buck this trend by having
    brightly colored hair (think Alias) as well as extensive bodily
    modification. There are commonalities, like androgyny and
    impressive-looking footwear, but these are commonalities, not
    uniforms.

    Thirdly, it is true that not all Goths practise magic. But then
    again, neither must they necessarily be spiritual; it depends on
    what a specific person believes. Some Goths, but not all, are
    members of a neo-pagan religion known as Wicca; while most people
    recognize proponents of this religion as 'witches', this, again, is
    not the case, as Wicca has its own rituals, spells and core beliefs
    way beyond the scope of this letter.

    And finally, and most importantly, I've never heard anyone say that
    you have to be a Westerner to qualify to enter the goth movement.
    The goth movement, if anything, is world-wide: it is more than not a
    reaction towards modernity and globalization, reflecting our fears
    of a uniform, bland world. Ex-Goth Wannabe, however, makes it sound
    like being a Goth is something like the Malay's propensity to 'amuk'
    and 'melatah' -- mental conditions restricted to a specific culture
    or ethnicity. After all, just because you become a Goth doesn't mean
    you have to give up your friends. That, after all, is their choice.

       </p>

    Besides, I've never met a goth who cared about what other people
    thought -- as a matter of fact, many Goths prefer to elicit any
    reaction, even a negative one, from people around them, rather than
    disappear into the crowd.

**Translation**: Ex-Goth Wannabe doesn't know what the hell he/she/it is
talking about.

Here's hoping it gets published, but if it doesn't, I don't mind. I've
had my say.
