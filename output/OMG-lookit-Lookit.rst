I'm'a `loony blogger`_, momma! A loony blogger!

Wow. First it was MENJ, now this… someone really loves me up there.

I feel like squealing like a fangirl and getting choked up at the same
time. I mean, look, this is what they say what people who make it into
the list are:

    The R.A.J.A.N. (R) Network is the Restricted [ as signified by the
    (R) ] edition of the original R.A.J.A.N. Network. It is a
    blogtal-cum-portal highlighting Malaysian (including those who think
    they are Israelis) blogs which can only belong to the radical
    fringe. Or in other words, these people have explicitly declared or
    projected themselves as radicals, are against the concept of
    universal justice and equality, and are totally naive when it comes
    to commenting on worldly issues.

    Getting yourself awarded a listing status in the Network, which
    carries the title "Rajan" (eg : Rajan Tun Datuk Seri Tan Sri Datin
    Ariel Sharon), is a rare honour, equivalent to a Toonship from the
    Malaysian Federal Government.

Wow. Rajan Tariq Kamal. That sounds so *cool*. Thanks, nominators! Vote
more for me, and get that fucker Rajan off the number one spot! Come, do
it. Do it, **bitch**!

Does that mean that now there'll be all sorts of gold-digging women who
are willing to fuck me for a moment of fame in their otherwise
insignificant lives? I mean, that's what titled people get, right?

[STRIKEOUT:**Updated**: The administrator's moved his setup to `MENJ`_'s
server. Very classy digs. Funny, though — he's disallowed comments. At
least on my side. Perhaps… no, course not. Why would he *ban* me?]

**Updated**: Guess not. Seems that *incompetence* was the problem, not
malice. The pop-up comment windows don't work — me believes that there's
a bit of slapdash coding there. My apologies to the administrators, who
are doing a *fine* job in making sure I get the recognition I deserve.
