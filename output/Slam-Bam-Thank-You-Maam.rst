Take a box of `these`_. Refrigerate them, since they're bound to be

Make a cup of `Milo`_, the way you like it.

   </p>

Bite off opposite corners of one of the aforementined confectionary. Put
it in the cup of Milo.

   </p>

Suck up some Milo with it, like a straw. Wait for it to *just* fall
apart. Pop it into your mouth. Realize that you should have put in a
*lot* less sugar.

Repeat four times. Feel sick. Call friend, who was asleep from trying to
do her MyKad application all day. Listen to her swear at you.

Lie down and wait out sugar-induced headache.
