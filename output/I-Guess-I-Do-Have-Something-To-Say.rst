It's still unsubstantiated, but I guess it's made me want to say
something about it.

    In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate, may peace be
    upon the cheerful one and the dauntless fighter, Prophet Muhammad,

    O nation of Islam and nation of Arabism: Rejoice for it is time to
    take revenge from the British Zionist Crusader government in
    retaliation for the massacres Britain is committing in Iraq and
    Afghanistan.

    The heroic mujahidin have carried out a blessed raid in London.
    Britain is now burning with fear, terror and panic in its northern,
    southern, eastern and western quarters.

    We have repeatedly warned the British government and people. We have
    fulfilled our promise and carried out our blessed military raid in
    Britain after our mujahidin exerted strenuous efforts over a long
    period of time to ensure the success of the raid.

    We continue to warn the governments of Denmark and Italy and all the
    Crusader governments that they will be punished in the same way if
    they do not withdraw their troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. He who
    warns is excused.
