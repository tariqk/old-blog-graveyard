"Bila lah you gonna put in comments?"

This question always gets asked, in one form or another.

I asked some people a different question: “So why exactly do you allow
the use of comments on your blog?”

I got two different kinds of answers. The first, and by far, the most
common, seems to be ‘user feedback’. The second answer, which `Hani`_
provided, was that she wanted more people to visit her page and talk
about the topic she posted in.

They're almost the same answer, except that the first seems to talk
about the Great Dialogue between the Writer and the Audience and the
second seems to be more about the Audience with the Audience — kind of
like a Great After-Movie Conversation.

Neither option appeals to me. Not really.

The one thing that bothers me the most about answer number one is the
horrific lack of control. Messages sent with answer number one in mind
must be answered, because if they don't, you know it's going to *stay
there*. Even if you remove 'em, which feels like capitulation to me,
unless of course the poster decides to post nothing but invective. And
those kind of posters are rare, even for the Internet.

The second answer bothers me because, well, for one, I used to be *that*
kind of person. I used to haunt `Aizuddin Danian`_'s page a *lot* —
commenting so often I ended up being the most talkative audience-member
there, right up until MT3's wonky commenting system drove me away. And
frankly, I knew that if I had so much to say on Aiz's blog, I might as
well have started on my own.

It's a emotional thing. I don't want people to comment to my blog posts.
Wait, that's a lie. I don't want anonymous people commenting on my blog
(*sullying* my pristine space with their *feelthy*, *feelthy*
appendages), and I don't want anyone else to see their feedback unless I
say so.

Which is why I like `LiveJournal`_-style comments. Since I can't get
that, however, I'll just limit the abilty to comment to other `blogger`_
users. It's not too hard to get a blogger account anyway. If you still
want to comment, but you don't want to register to blogger, just email
me at tboy [at] bebudak [dot] net (you clever humans figure it out). If
there's anything interesting about what you say I'll post it up.

Unless you know me. Then just beard me through whatever private channels
you have access to.

Oh, and yeah. `Pick Yin`_ gave me this `post`_ of hers, talking about
Blogger's commenting system. Don't know where to put this, so I put it
here.
