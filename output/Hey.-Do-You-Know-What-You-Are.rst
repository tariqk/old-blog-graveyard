Hey. Do You Know What You Are?

You're a blogger. And, possibly, if you're like me, you're a young
blogger. And if you're not like me, you're a young female blogger.

How much shit does a young female blogger go through, on her daily tromp
through the Internet?

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I mean, really. I got a friend, who's American. She's a fan of Digimon,
loves Japanese miniature dolls, and has a membership with `OkCupid`_.
She also gets, you know, the occasional creepy missive from some young
buck who wants to have sex with her.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

She doesn't blog. She's also a teenager.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

And this is just a teenager; we're not talking about some woman who
decides to, you know, for personal reasons, `expose herself in a public
medium :sup:`**[NSFW]**``_. Which she is perfectly entitled to. Hey,
it's your body, do what you like with it.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I can't possibly imagine `Hani`_ doing it, for example. She's got her
mother, whom she lives with, who is conservative in many ways. You tend
to restrict yourself in many ways when the lady you might offend
controls your purse-strings and your freedoms.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

But Hani's been famous for being seen, once, long ago, as one of the
tell-lots exposé blogs on the Internet. And there were no pictures in
that one of her nude. There were plenty of requests, hey, sure. Young
bucks who want a quick lay. Or geeks who wanted to be friends. Some of
them made for quite good friendships; `safe`_ `ones`_, `with`_ `no`_
`scandalous`_ `behaviour`_ `in`_ `public`_ `or`_ `private`_.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

That's not what her mother, or the parents of any young lady who blogs,
might see when they get a load of `this`_.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Oh, great. And you'd think that blogging would be *respectable* by now.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

The best part was that you know, readers who came in her blog would have
immediately, without being warned, seen her naked self on the blog. No
NSFW tags. No warnings. Nothing. Just a post, and then TITS! YAY!

.. raw:: html

   </p>

If you were a young, hot-blooded guy. It's a different story if you
were, say, underaged. Or at work. Or not attracted to women. Or surfing
the Internet when your father's walking behind you, looking over your
shoulder. Or if you're a blogger, and your father comes to you and says,
“\ `Ah Jay, do you do these things on the Internet? Are you mixing with
these kinds of people?`_\ ”. Or if you're a blogger, `trying`_ `to`_
`look`_ `respectable`_ in a field that has a reputation of being full of
attention-whores.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

No, no, no. Nothing rosy, I'm sure. No one was hurt, sure. `No tears
were shed`_.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Oh, *tough*. We live in a conservative society, with moral axioms
seemingly cast-iron hard except when expediency and discretion bend the
rules. Oh boo hoo hoo, your father doesn't understand you. Oh boo hoo
hoo, people are judging you, calling you names. Oh boo hoo hoo,
stupidity reigns when you suddenly *decided to disregard the society you
live in for what might now seem like a case of poor impulse control*.
Let me play the world's smallest violin.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Times like this, I always bring out a favourite axiom of mine.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

.. raw:: html

   <p>

    “There is a line between being slutty, and being *stupid*.”

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Guess who was stupid.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

**Edited**: I added in a [NSFW] tag on a potentially offensive link. My
apologies to everyone who weren't informed prior — the pictures were not
visible during the time of posting due to bandwitdh overrun on the site.
