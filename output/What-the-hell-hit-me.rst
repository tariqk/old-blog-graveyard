What the hell hit me?

Okay, so I sent a comment to Jeff Ooi’s blog about `this particular
post`_ :

    I don’t know about the rest of you, but the reason why I didn’t talk
    about the technology behind the whole leak was because I didn’t give
    a damn on the authenticity of the video, or where it came from. I
    instead focused on the rather sorry state of the relationship
    between the police and the community they were supposed to be
    protecting.

    The fact that technology uncovered this means nothing. The issue was
    that we were, and still are, so willing to believe it, because
    that’s how we view the police. Whether this was because of the
    actions and the integrity of the police or the administration or
    something that is inherent in Malaysians, I don’t know.

    Oh, and Jeff… I am a reader of your blog, I admit that. People have
    called me your h0, and there’s a grain of truth in what they say.
    But you know something? Sometimes you can be a big jerk. This,
    matey, is one of those times.

    Thumbs down.

Here’s his response:

    JEFF OOI says: I don’t make a living out of blogging, much less am I
    here on a beuty parade or on a popularity race. So, must I give a
    damn as to what/how you feel so long as I keep my e-space serene and
    rational? If you urge to hand down decree, go jerk it elsewhere.
    Here, you play by my rules.

Huh. Intellectual masturbation reference, and then implied insult to my
‘lifestyle blogger’ position. Which I don’t even care about, since I’ve
never really done the whole “blogging as a lifestyle” thing.

I honestly don’t know how to think about this. Okay, so… I come into his
blog, knowing full well that I do play by his rules. Yeah, okay, so
probably I walked into that.

For some reason I keep getting the feeling that the response I got from
him was not proportional to the “attack” or decree I made. I made a
decree? What, who voted and made me Member of Parliament?

I am, actually, kind of in shock. Mind you, Jeff’s always struck me as a
bit of a robot. I’ve never had any meaningful interaction with him,
other than the usual rare, curt and brusque reply. His posts tend to be
impenetrable, or at the very least, not aimed at my target market. Maybe
because I’m a popularity race or beauty train blogger. Yeah, that’s
probably it.

I’m still thinking about whether this crossed the line between firm
reminder and Going Too Far.

Hell, I’m still thinking whether what I said or did was wrong or not. I
guess this is what happens when someone big bitch-slaps you around. You
stagger around, in shock.
