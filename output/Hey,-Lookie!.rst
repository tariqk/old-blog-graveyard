I got impatient for Amazon to index my Wish List, so I decided to cheat
a little.

I'd be lying if I said that I just wanted people to see how ultimately
refined my tastes are, and just say it out loud my true intentions: **I
Want Presents for My Birthday**.

Ha ha. There. I've said it. It's November the 6th this year, mind you.

Anyway, here's the link. I'm putting it at the Horrible NASCAR-like
affiliation list, and I'll probably whine a bit just before my birthday.

Anyway, a few highlights:

-  **Usagi Yojimbo Book 3: The Wanderer's Road** — I love Stan Sakai's
   Usagi Yojimbo. Funny, usually I mock furries, but a couple of my
   favourite artists draw anthromorphic animals. One of them is Stan
   Sakai; the other is `Dave Kelley`_, who drew `Living In Greytown`_.
   Anyway. I've got all of Stan's early Usagi books save this one: the
   one where Jei, Usagi's insane archnemesis, makes his first
   appearance. Which is a shame.
-  **Paranoia XP** — The first Paranoia RPG was published by `West End
   Games`_ (which publishes boring shit like TORG now, I think).
   Whatever. *This* new game is like the old one, except that it's
   updated for the millenium. And it's published by `Mongoose
   Publishing`_. There are two things that make Paranoia special. One,
   is that unlike other RPGs, Paranoia encourages you to be a
   back-stabbing bastard. Secondly, it's funny as hell.
-  **Y: The Last Man (Book 2, 3, 4)**— Imagine, in the near future, that
   every male mammal on this planet died suddenly. Every one, save for
   two males: Yorick Brown, an unemployed escape artist, and his pet
   monkey. Yes, it's perfectly serious stuff. Honestly. I've got Book 1.
   It's perfectly serious, gripping stuff. Even when Yorick's sister,
   Hero, joins the Amazons and burns off her right breast.
-  **B.P.R.D: The Soul of Venice and Other Stories** — Forget the damn
   movie, Hellboy the comic is so much better. I've got the first book
   in this series, and Liz Sherman and Abe Sapien are much more rounded
   and interesting characters than they are in the movie.

That's it. I'm such a whore ^^

Okay, seriously. I don't really mind if no-one gets this for me, but you
know, there might be, just *might* be, people out there who might want
to. And, really, I had two options: either drop hints to people (and
risk people getting the wrong message or me forgetting), or be explicit.

Guess which route I'm taking.
