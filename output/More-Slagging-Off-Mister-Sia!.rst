…alah, not really lah. Kesian the poor bugger.

Actually, the whole brouhaha started from this one `snippet`_:

       </p>

    We talked about the Singaporean blog culture, the upcoming Blogger's
    convention, the commercial aspect of blogging, among other things.
    One thing I realised from our conversation is how much more mature
    and serious the blog culture is in Singapore compared to the rest of
    Asia. Its evident from the facts. Mr brown, Miyagi are writing for
    Today; Wendy is writing for The New Paper, Maxim, endorsing
    LocalBrand; and most interestingly, commercial entities are
    APPROACHING the Bloggercon organizers for sponsorship, instead of
    the other way round.

    All these are happening while Malaysian bloggers are still gloating
    over how they got their first cheques from Google Adsense.

Aduh, zing! And then suddenly all these people hentam him for being
`traitor to`_ `Malaysian bloggokind`_. Oh noes! What to do?

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Actually, Kenny has a point.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

He's got a point when he says that Singaporean bloggers and Malaysian
bloggers are different. Of course they are — there's a slew of
differences between Malaysian and Singaporean culture that are
remarkably evident, especially if you cross the Straits. There's nothing
mysterious about *that*.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

What Kenny flubs in his explanation is in his use of the word “mature”.
You know, for a Big Name Blogger he sure made a poor choice in using
that word.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Malaysian blogging aren't less mature than Singapore blogging — what
Singapore blogging is that Malaysian blogging isn't is *mainstream*.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

A medium's maturity isn't defined by how easily mainstream culture
absorbs it. Examples that come to mind, at least for me, include comics
(when don't they, when it comes to me talking about media?).

Comics enjoyed this remarkable spike in popularity in the popular
conscience, *way* back in the early 20th century, with the works of
`Winsor McCay`_ actually gracing the pages of newspapers, not in the
strangled comic-strip syndication deals we get nowadays, but as
full-blown works of art, as a *feature*.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Look at McCay's works, and compare it to Singapore bloggers writing
appearing in print publications, and the wooing of bloggers by Singapore
mainstream media. There are a few differences (McCay engaged with the
news media as as himself, and not in their own terms), but the
similarities are there, and can be made into pretty good comparisons.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

But were comics in the early 20th century considered “mature” media?
Hardly. That period showed an incredible proliferation of two kinds of
work — experimental works ala Winsor McCay's *Little Nemo in
Slumberland*, and imitatory works, ala Batman, Superman, and other early
superhero works.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Seriously. Early Batman comics, for example, were straight (somewhat)
translations of traditional detective fiction — the only difference
being that the detective in this case wore spandex. Superman was modeled
after mythical heroes, and its tales were straightforward morality plays
that appealed to pulp fiction fans, who more often than made up the new
audience for comic readers.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

It's the same kind of tale for other kinds of media as well — early
stories were more often than not transcribings of oral tales, early
prose fiction were essentially epic poems forced into sequential text,
early computer game efforts resembled board games and serious
literature.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

And ‘early blogs’ resemble… what? Diaries, made online? Editorials, made
online? Journalistic pieces, made online? Academic dissertations,
simplified and made online? Ranting, made online?

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Dude, blogs and blog culture are nowhere near mature. I suspect, at any
rate, that blogs and blog culture *anywhere* won't start becoming mature
until years from now, when people finally know what to do with blogs and
what blogs are best at, the way people know what to do with comics and
what comics are good at.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Until then, wait with bated breath.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

**Addendum**: Hmm. Pinging both `Kenny's`_ and `Paul`_'s blog nets me
with a big fat zero. Pages won't update.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

…hmm. Oh well. Their loss. I've got better things to do with my life.
And besides, `Hani`_ wants my attention now.
