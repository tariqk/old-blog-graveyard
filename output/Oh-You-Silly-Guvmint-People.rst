*Inspired by `a friend of mine`_. I don't agree with her a lot, but she
has a point. Yes, she's a LiveJournal user. So?*

Typical life. I spend the weekend [STRIKEOUT:under a bed, living on my
own refuse and crying like a man with his soul broken up by cruel, cruel
fate] spending time with my family and friends, and `someone Way Up
There stirs up a hornet's nest`_ we call the Malaysian
[STRIKEOUT:“blogosphere”] Blogging Community.

Just a question to Jalan Riong: Why *lah* so stupid? Oh, I'm sure that
what you want will eventually happen, and you know, things will
eventually settle down to the horribly unpleasant status quo that
everyone seems to desire, so why bother doing this? All you've done is
made `Jeff`_ famous. And if it's anything, he doesn't *need* to get any
more famous.

I like Jeff. Not because he's funny, or amusing, or even personable (I
don't even *know* the man, so how would I know?), but because he has
that obssessive-compulsive streak about him; the kind of
obssessive-compulsive streak that's very useful if you were, say, a
`MAS`_ or `ASTRO`_ customer. Very useful.

Except now that you've made him all saintly and shit, because you've
just decided to take on the role of the Bad Guy. The Bad Guy with the
UMNO-Youth-style manner of intimidation, all force and no class. You
might know what I'm talking about — the self-righteous, easily-offended
martyr for his race who wants the people who said those *hurtful hurtful
things* to stop, and he'll beat up and intimidate everybody, like some
kind of `Johorian Loan Shark`_ [STRIKEOUT:or my girlfriend on PMS] to
get his way.

I mean, really. You even got `TV Smith`_ to `write poetry`_. *Poetry*.
It looks like Bad Goth Poetry. My GOD. It's an *ode*. I never thought
he'd stoop so low.

You know what the fan-bloggers, the bloggers who write about unimportant
shit like who dies in *Buffy* and why Captain Archer's so fucking hot
(can't say I disagree with that, hoo *boy*!) or why they want to marry
Legolas and have his squealing babies think when they see the righteous
furor that the Jalan Riong nastiness has engendered?

   </p>

“My God,” they'd say. “They're *blog-wanking*.”

   </p>

And it's all your fault. Thanks a lot, Jalan Riong. Now they're just
going to be insufferable. All that heat from the Higher Ups, see. Dries
out their sense of humor. Very the not nice to see, you.

And I know I'm gonna catch some flak now. If only in the form of
well-intentioned advice.
