On Blogging.

`The Scarfer`_'s just `announced her intention to take a hiatus`_.
Almost a month ago, `the Datin`_ decided to `do the same`_.

They're two completely different people, with relatively little in
common, apart from the fact that they're involved with someone ‘exotic’
(one is married to a Datuk, the other is dating a gwailo), and that
they're both female, and obvious shit like that…

Basically they've got nothing in common. Save for one thing. They spoke
their minds, realized that to some point, they were wrong, found out
that people didn't like them for being wrong, and realized that
blogging, formerly `the panacea for troubled minds`_, has become too
much. The things people said have become too painful, blood has been
drawn, and it's time to pull back and lick your wounds. The game isn't
fun anymore.

You know, I'm terrified this would happen to me. Hence, I limited
attempts for people to post their feedback on my blog, reasoning that
the kind of people who would do stupid, hurtful things to me would be
those who don't think about what they say, and find that it's easier to
talk trash than to STFU.

At least, when they're struggling to either 1) register to `Blogger`_ or
2) write me an email, if what they're saying is important, they'll find
a way to say it, and if it turns out that what they're saying is
wrong-headed and obviously contrary to Natural Law, hey, they're sad
fuckers.

Or that could just be a rationalization and all I want to do is talk
without being bothered. And when I don't want to talk, I'll just let go
of blogging, without having to tell you folks that I'll be in a hiatus.

I just realized something. In almost any literary or textual medium, the
author owes the audience something. It could be money, in the case of
novelists and authors, or it could be trust, in the case of a journalist
or a newspaper columnist. But a blogger owes his audience nothing.

The audience comes to a blog in their own free will, and can leave
without accruing penalty, other than wasted bandwidth, which the blogger
has to pay as well. Nothing is owed between the blogger and his
audience, other than what the either side believes. And belief is the
flimsiest coin there is, even on such a nebulous realm like the
Internet.

I can leave, I can call you all names, I can profess the foulest
doctrines that could turn the stomachs of any right-thinking reader
around the planet. And I still wouldn't be responsible for you. Any
responsibility I have is what I take up, and I am in no condition to be
punctual, inoffensive or even Right. I just need to Be.

Of course, you, the audience, don't have to listen to what I have to
say, either, or even visit me. That's your right. It's also the right of
the reader of fiction, nonfiction, journalism or whatever, but I think
blogging is special. Blogging is, probably, the only media where it is
all right to be not listened to.

I could be wrong. It's something that's coming out,
stream-of-thought-ish, you see.
