On Being Multi-Cultural

I had a fairly angry blog entry before this, but something in
`minishorts`_\ ’ blog `changed my mind`_. So I’ve decided to make a
rewrite.

Fitting into Multicultural Societies is Hard Stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

You might not think there is a link between what MENJ says `here`_ and
`here <http://blog.menj.org/index.php/2005/10/22/100-christian-proofs-of-islamic-falsehood/>`__
with a certain `MP’s so-called ‘racist’ statements in parliament`_.
Admittedly, there are fundamental differences—the Member of Parliament
in question is a cretin (not unlike many of his counterparts), while
MENJ is, by all indications, of above-average intelligence and
education.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

But both have one thing in common. They do not fit into a multicultural
society.

You Tak Suka?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I don’t say this to mean as if it is a bad thing. I don’t mean to go at
the MP or MENJ and say, “\ `You Tidak Suka, You Keluar Dari
Malaysia!`_\ ” —although admittedly, it would be *fun* and ironic to say
to the MP himself, who has made himself inadvertantly famous by putting
his foot in his mouth with *that* statement.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

But the fact of the issue is, you live in a society where not everybody
thinks and lives like you, and it is not likely that they will *ever* do
so.

   </p>

In An Idealized World
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Not because it should be this way—let’s face it, in an *idealized*
world, everyone would have his own space, everyone would belong, and
there wouldn’t be any conflict between anyone at all. But let’s face
it—there are about 23 million people crammed by history and circumstance
into an area approximately 330 thousand square kilometers big. That
isn’t a lot of space.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

And when you’re all crammed up like that, one of the last things you
want to talk about is how people should behave and where they belong and
what is the true truth. You’re just struggling to not push the other
feller into the sea (where they could probably sue your sorry ass for
being an ass), or get pushed in either.

   </p>

Priorities, Man, Priorities.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I’m not saying that what you believe and what you say is unimportant.
I’m saying, look at your other priorities first. You don’t live in an
all-Malay (oxymoronic—have you heard of a ‘true Malay’?) all-Muslim
country. You live in a multicultural one, which means that you *must*
accommodate. Not *should*, because frankly I’d go somewhere else if I
could, but *must*.

   </p>

And if you don’t, well, why should the other guy?
