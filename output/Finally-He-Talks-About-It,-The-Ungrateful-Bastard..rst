You've heard `people blogging`_ `about it`_. You've heard `rumors and
comments`_. `You've`_ `even`_ `seen`_ `some`_ `pictures`_. But not a
word from the Birthday Boy.

Well, that's because the Birthday Boy has been too busy to post up
something decent. And to be honest, everyone's said everything there is
to say. Except for a few important announcements.

I'd like to thank `Hani`_ for being such a wonderful help in organizing
the iftar. Truth be told, she was the one who came up with the idea and
did most of the talking, while I stressed out on work and stuff. She had
work too, which meant that she was doubly amazing. I Love you, Sayang.

I'd also like to thank `Ash`_ for letting me hang around his house to
play his copy of Fable, which was fun.

I also would like to thank `Pick Yin`_ for coming over Ash's place and
her present, the ever-delectable B.P.R.D. I enjoyed the book, lass.
Thank you for being cool and having excellent taste :D

I also would like to thank U-Jin, my old college mate for coming for the
iftar. I know we were like too intellectually advanced for you, kiddo,
but you handled yourself swimmingly.

   </p>

Hell, while I'm at it I'll thank `Nina`_ and TJ for coming over. I
especially want to thank Nina some more, since she actually handled
herself marvellously during the iftar, even if she was surrounded by…
perish the thought… *bloggers*. I'm so sorry, girl.

Anyway. Then there's `Jordan`_ and Leen, who were amazing and wonderful
and funny and witty, and too far away to listen to all the time, damnit.
Next time I call dibs on sitting near them. Thank you for the card, you
two. It amuses.

I'd like to thank `Jikon`_ for coming over as well, and for being so
damn pretty. Ha! Yes you were. Do not deny it, you photogenic bastard.
I'm glad you had fun, though.

`Najah`_ and `Fische`_, thank you. I'm guessing you two were the ones
who masterminded the Kinokuniya book coupons, so I got to thank you for
that. And thank you, Fische, for being such a good sport when we teased
you.

Come to think of it, thanks, Ash, for not beating teh g4y outta me for
what I did to you. Ho ho ho. ^o^

   </p>

Thank you all, you readers who wished me well during, before and after
my birthday. I used to fantasize about having a lot of friends for my
birthday, and hey, it's come true. Thank you all for making a lonely,
lonely child very, very happy.
