VCDs, guns and dangdut tempatan.

Check it out. `Shit hitting the fan.`_

Actually, if you check out `Jeff Ooi`_'s `blog`_ `entries`_, it looks
like more than one piece of excrement\ :sup:``1`_` hitting more than one
electrical contrivance for moving air for ventilation via rapid rotation
of rigid vanes using an electrical motor\ :sup:``2`_`.

I guess it isn't a good time to be a cop in Malaysia right now. Or is
it?

If I have to be cynical\ :sup:``3`_`, I could be saying, "Cops fuck up!
Innocent people get hurt! `Film at 11!`_". Seriously, how is this
anything other than ‘business as usual’?

I'd really be exaggerating if I said that Malaysians live in fear of the
police. But I wouldn't be exaggerating that far. We don't *trust* the
police. Not with our lives. Which seems a terribly wrong thing, but
what're you going to do about it?

The land of the knee-jerks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Amusingly, Malaysians reacted to the whole scene the way they usually
do: with moral indignation over what was seen as the abuse of power by
the powerful\ :sup:``4`_`, and cries of radical change that is sorely
needed to rectify the Great Wrong That Has Already Happened.

Except that banning cops from using guns, as some people have already
suggested, is impractical, not to mention predictably knee-jerk. That's
what we do when we Malaysians see something that threatens us, and our
way of life. We move to eliminate it.

It's the same with long hair in television, movies that portray The
Enemy in a sympathetic light, groups of people who deviate from the
Great Norm. We try to stamp it out. Well, actualy, the Government tries
to stamp it out.

We're just very good students.

Ban it 'til it glows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We've learnt to deal with things that scare or unnerve or frighten us
that way. We try to edit it out of our lives. Sure, a certain amount of
denial is healthy -- certainly to mend bridges, to forget past hurts --
but this isn't a healthy amount of denial. Police-men need guns.
Enforcement officials of Ministries and municipal councils don't.
Certainly not against VCD sellers.

On the extremely insensitive but humorous point, though, you could
really say that we're dealing with the piracy problem in a strict
manner. What's next, `roadside executions for copyright violators`_?

Man, there goes the Malaysian tertiary education community.

Making things right, Malaysian style
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Of course, the Innocent Bystander now `has to pay 15,000 ringgit`_ to
get a bullet off his back. A bullet, mind you, that got fired because an
enforcement officer fucked up. People are urging the ministry to do
something, and so far, all they've offered is their profuse apologies.
Which is obviously not enough, so `people are telling the ministry to
pay the guy's bills`_, to demonstrate our how loving and caring we are.

Load of crap. The Ministry should pay the surgical fees before the
factory worker decides to get Ideas Beyond His Station and sue.

Of course, the Ministry has a great chance of winning -- our justice
system is far from perfect, and we're not as litigation-happy as, say,
the Americans. But seriously, the guy has everything to gain, and the
Ministry has everything to lose -- even if the Ministry wins.

I'm sure Lim Kit Siang and Karpal Singh are cackling away, at Opposition
Headquarters…

    **Lim Kit Siang**: Ha, ha, Comrade Karpal, an opportunity to make
    those idiots at BN look like fools!

    **Karpal Singh**: Why yes, Comrade Lim. And I can look extra good
    doing (*quotation mark gesture*) ‘pro-bono work’!

    **LKS**: Mwahahahahaha!

    **KS**: Mwahahahaha!

Settle out of court, and get the guy back on his feet. It's better than
getting your ass hauled into the fire with the press. Or with bloggers.
Who aren't ethical, as a rule\ :sup:``5`_`.
