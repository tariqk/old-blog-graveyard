I'm a celebrity now! I got quoted in `MENJ`_'s blog. Woo hoo!

And he called me a dickhead! All right!

Do I read his `blog`_? No, not really.

Oh. What's my problem with him?

I dunno. Don't read his shit. I just needed an example of a ‘bad
blogger’, so I chose him, based on the amount of bitching I've heard
about him (yeah, bloggers are the quintessential Internet dwellers). I
can't believe he read my blog! Whoa! Next thing you know `Jeff Ooi`_'s
gonna come by, read what I say, and call me a cocksucking motherfucker.

That would *so* awesome. Please, Jeff, if you read this, I'm like your
worst enemy and shit, and I think you should be buggered by angry
hornets. I'd be ever so grateful if you, like, describe what I do with
my mother every night in embarrasing detail. Ok, thanks, bye!
