I'm rediscovering the Internet again. Or at least stuff connected to
blogging, geekdom and… hey, `Nash Bridges`_ is pretty cool. Lots of
slash material.

   **`bash.org`_**: Plenty of stupid IRC humor. I just can't stop
   laughing everytime I read their entries.

       |  I swear to god

       |  I've just heard a duck tell a joke

       |  o...k

       |  there was as group of ducks on a pond near where i live

       |  one of the ducks was quacking away looking straight at a group
       of like 10 ducks

       |  then he stopped and all the other ducks went mental

       |  it looked just like duck stand-up comedy

   **`Bloglines`_**: `Pick Yin`_ and `Hani`_ recommended this a long
   time ago. I like it, and I wonder what kept me away from it. Nice
   thing is, there's a Mozilla plugin.

       |  What will you give me if I deliver him to you?

       |  well, let´s see

       |  betraying the Son of man, leading to his untimely death and
       kissing a bearded guy

       |  that would be about 30 pieces of silver
