Thinking About the Geek Code.

I've encountered two websites discussing the `Geek Code`_ recently,
which was rather fashionable in geek circles during the nineties:

   </p>

-  One was in `MENJ's blog`_, in which he showed his particular `Blogger
   Code`_ snippet. The Blogger Code is essentially a `fork`_ of the
   original Geek Code. It also tells me that the last thing he'd want to
   have sex with is a blogger. Can't say I blame him.
-  The other was in the `Y!PP Forums`_, in which they were discussing an
   addition to the Geek Code, specifically one that was Y!PP-related.

The Geek Code's nice and esoteric and stuff, but there are several
things about the whole thing that rubs me the wrong way:

.. raw:: html

   </p>

-  It's a centralized development effort, and the developer hasn't
   budged off his butt to work on it for years now. Presumably he's too
   busy with real life, which is understandable. Thing is, I think
   `people have approached the creator`_ to actually continue the whole
   thing, but apparently he doesn't like that. So, bwah.
-  As a result of the lack of updating, the Geek Code website is so
   outdated. I mean, really. This was way before IMs and P2P, and what
   with all the fandoms the Geek Code doesn't really represent everyone
   on the Internet any more. Not even the geeks, a category which has
   expanded.
-  Single developer, single point of updating, centralized
   decision-making… man, that just so sucks. The Code should really be
   extensible and linkable, with the abilty for Geeks to define their
   own symbols and ranges.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

So it got me to thinking. What's stopping me from making a similar Geek
Code system? Well, apart from pissing off the originator. I don't know,
but here's what the new (proposed) code should do:

.. raw:: html

   </p>

-  It should be compact -- I mean, we could do it in XML, but XML
   development, from what I can see, is like a whole troop of maddened
   kittens thrown into a tar pit.
-  Plus, XML is remarkably elephantine for what should be a nice, clean
   code, which can be mildly comprehensible to anyone with an
   arbitrarily large number of neurons with active, healthy synapses.
-  And then there's the issue of it being extensible. I don't think
   anyone should be in control of the Geek Code definitions. I mean, if
   you're gonna do it, you might as well link a definition file to the
   code block to some remote file.
-  Again, brevity should win over completeness, though the link might be
   better off being a URI -- everyone knows what a URI is. Well, you
   know 'em as URLs. Web addresses.
-  What we should define, however, is the code conventions themselves,
   and how to define the Geek Code definition files. You'd need to talk
   about what each symbol means, and how you'd define symbols and stuff
   like that…
-  It's too fucking late to talk about something so fucking trivial like
   this. Geez. But I'm obsessive this way.
-  Anyway, geez, I don't know.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

So. Basically, Geek Code could do with being modular, Geek Code defs
should be left to The People (get a central clearing-house for Geek Code
defs if you're worried about malformed definitions, and get a reputation
of being reliable, instead hogging all developmental rights to
yourself), XML is too fat for the Geek Code, and the new Geek Code
should go as far as describing the conventions and the format for
definition files and no more. And I should sleep earlier, and not do
this sort of thing at 1 am in the goddamned morning.

So, anyway. Rambling. Ah heh.
