Right, okay.

I just took a look at three of the last significant blog posts I’ve
done, and they were dour, solemn and wanky.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

This is not good. I belong, first and foremost, to the geek-dork-nerd
spectrum: I need to think about feeding that part of my Internet Soul,
really.

   </p>

So here’s the deal.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

I would like to run a role-playing game campaign in the near future. The
idea is mostly embryonic, and largely impulsive—I’ve yet to think about
when to do this, how many people will want to do it, et cetera.

   </p>

But I’ll let that worry come later. I’ve got other fish to fry.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Okay. Here are the games I have, separated by system and continuity:

.. raw:: html

   </p>

-  `White Wolf`_\ ’s `Storyteller System`_

   .. raw:: html

      </p>

   #. `Old World of Darkness`_

      .. raw:: html

         </p>

      -  `Mage: the Ascension`_ 3e
      -  `Werewolf: the Apocalypse`_

   #. Æon Trinity

      .. raw:: html

         </p>

      -  `Adventure!`_
      -  `Abberant`_
      -  `Trinity`_

-  `Wizards of the Coasts`_\ ’ `d20 system`_

   .. raw:: html

      </p>

   #. WotC’s `Dungeons and Dragons`_ 3.5e
   #. White Wolf’s `Ravenloft`_
   #. WotC/Lucas Licensing’s `Star Wars RPG`_

-  Other Systems

   .. raw:: html

      </p>

   #. Mongoose Publishing’s `Paranoia`_

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Now, there are a couple of games I’d like to get, both in PDF format:

.. raw:: html

   </p>

-  Atomic Sock Monkey’s `Dead Inside`_
-  Lumpley Game’s `Dogs in the Vineyard`_

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Sadly, these seem to be in the future.

.. raw:: html

   </p>

Now, take a look at these games. Ask questions if you want, in the
comments, and I’ll answer them ASAP—if you need more description of what
each game is like (though honestly, I don’t really know—never did find
the players to try them in detail).

.. raw:: html

   </p>

All right. Fire away.
