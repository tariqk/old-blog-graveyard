When it comes to the battle between traditional mass media and bloggers,
I don’t usually take either side. I still don’t; both are sleazy and
stupid in their own ways, and I don’t feel like I need to comment about
their foibles any more.

But I need to link you to `this`_.

Why? Three reasons:

.. raw:: html

#. It’s on `LiveJournal`_, a service typically associated with angsty
   diarists and fen who write all sorts of crap. I happen to like LJ, so
   having this happen on it is something that pleases me. The service
   doesn’t matter, only the content.
#. It’s an important news item. It needs to be seen, it needs to be
   told.
#. It’s being written by the people **who are there**. You'll never get
   better coverage than this; and from people who have a stake at it,
   not some armchair wanker like me or slick media pirate.
