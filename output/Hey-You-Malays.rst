Did you guys see the PETRONAS ad that was aired on TV3, just after the
news?

You know who made that? My dad. I know, it's disgraceful how gleefully
proud I am right now.

The ironic part is that I have, for quite a while, wanted to talk about
the state of my own ethnicity, what with calls to bring back
[STRIKEOUT:Bumi-centric favoritism] affirmative action and our
kris-waving [STRIKEOUT:demagogues] leaders….

And I was beaten to the punch by my dad! Sure, even he admits that the
ad was “preachy” (I think it's a little cheesy myself), but hee hee hee!
What a message!

“It's better to step forwards than to take a step back”? How's that for
a kick in the nuts, you fuckers?

   </p>

Hee hee hee. I've been pwned rather comprehensively by my own father.
That's not the unusual part, no sir — what's unusual is that I'm quite
enjoying it.

How's that for a kick in the nuts, haa? Heh.
