I've had `two`_ `blogs`_ before this; well, technically `three`_, but
the third one doesn't work as well as I wanted it to be.

I was satisfied, lurking in semi-obscurity, until I received an email
from someone with my name.

My first impulse was that the email was spam (how many of you have
received emails that came from you but were *really* selling
penis-enlargement medicine?), but for once, this email is genuine.

It's from Tariq Kamal, a Palestinian-American commercial artist living
in Los Angeles. He's an English major and a member of `The Free Speech
Show`_'s ensemble cast, so some of you might have heard of him.

He likes the way I write. He thinks my girlfriend is hot (I agree with
him). And he found this, `a letter I wrote`_, a long time ago,
compelling.

Wow. I thought only people like John Grisham and J.K Rowling were called
that.

Anyway. Here's what he's got to say about this laughable circus I call
my blog:

    Tariq Kamal's blog is some of the most insightful and compelling
    material I've read on the Web, and I'm not just saying that because
    we have the same name. Intelligent, thought-provoking, and deeply
    personal, Tariq spares no effort in blowing the minds of his readers
    with each new entry.

I honestly don't know what he's talking about, boys and girls, but I
just report what I've got in my mailbox.

   </p>

Anyway. Maybe it's time I started working on consolidating all of my
entries. Not looking forward to that, though.
